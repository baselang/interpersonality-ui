        GUIDES_ROMANTIC_REPORT_INTRO_DESC:"<p>Picking your romantic partner is arguably the most important decision you make in life. </p><p>Could they be the one? In this guide, you'll find out.</p><p>So much attention is given to saving a relationship, but so little is given towards picking the right person in the first place. You've made an incredibly smart decision by considering compatibility early on.</p><p>In these pages, you'll find out if you are compatible. You'll find out in minutes what would have taken months or years of dating to find out.</p><p>But before we get into that, we want to point out a few mistakes that people tend to make, over and over. If you want to avoid these pitfalls yourself, take a minute to read this page before diving into the guide itself.</p><br/><h3>Pick your problems</h3><p>When you pick a partner, you are picking a set of problems that you will deal with for the rest of your life. </p><p>Everyone will have flaws.</p><p>Your fights and conflicts with one person will be different than those you have with another. But even in happy, stable marriages, the couples fight over many of the same things for decades. It's inevitable.</p><p>The question is, which 'flaws' are you OK with?</p><br/><h3>Don't expect them to change</h3><p>It's tempting to try to ignore someone's flaws during the dating phase, hoping that you'll be able to fix those flaws when you get into a serious relationship.</p><p>To think that it's fine now, because it can be changed later.</p><p>Spoiler: 99% of the time, it doesn't change.</p><p><blockquote><b>\"Love is the experience of fully accepting someone as they are right now.\"</b></blockquote></p><p>If you love someone with the expectation that they will change, you don't love them. Full stop.</p><p>It's important to accept your partner as they are, with zero expectation that any of their flaws will ever go away. And to love them anyway.</p><p>This doesn't mean you can't help each other grow. But entering a relationship on the premise that the 'bad' things can be fixed later is a fool's errand.</p><br/><h3>Fall in love with them, not the idea of them</h3><p>If you have a strong goal for a specific kind of relationship - like having a committed partner or getting married and having kids - you might push to create that kind of relationship with your date before you know them well enough to be sure that they are the right match for you.</p><p>You could fall in love with the idea of who you want them to be, not who they actually are.</p><p>Eventually, the bubble will burst. They aren't who you thought they were, all because you had this idea of who they were and forced them into the fantasy relationship you had in your head.</p><p>It leads to bitter disappointment and heartbreak. But many people then go on to do it again with someone else - this <i>new</i> person is the magical one who fits my fantasy.</p><p>Don't let that be you. This is a trap that even the smartest people fall into. By reading this guide, you have a huge step forward in grounding yourself in the reality of who they really are, and if you are really compatible.</p><br/><h3>The two-year rule</h3><p>Research shows that people who get married after dating for less than 2 years have <b>much</b> higher divorce rates than people who date for more than two years before getting married.</p><p>It's important to let the honeymoon period fade, and to have figured out how to handle your recurring problems and differences <i>before</i> you get married.</p><p>Because getting married won't solve your problems.</p><br/><h3>Getting married won't solve your problems</h3><p>Many couples have problems they grapple with, and get married anyway hoping that, \"once we're married, we'll figure everything out.\"</p><p>Unfortunately, it doesn't work like that.</p><p>Marriage doesn't make the problems magically go away.</p><p>In fact, it's often harder to fix problems after marriage because the stakes are much higher and so both people are more emotionally attached to their side of the problem.</p>",
        GUIDES_ROMANTIC_REPORT_INTRO_DYNAMIC_CONTENT_HEADING:"Highlights",
        GUIDES_COUPLE_REPORT_INTRO_DESC:"<p>Nothing affects your happiness like the quality of your relationship.</p><p>By investing in this guide, you've taken an important step towards making big improvements in your relationship.</p><p>Instead of trying to change who you are, or trying to change who your partner is, we're going to focus on the <i>dynamics</i> created between the two of you - and how to improve those dynamics.</p><p>But before we get into that, we need to lay down a foundation. It's important that you read this page before reading the rest of the guide.</p><h3>🔑 Two key things</h3><p className='research_remove_paragraph_bottom_margin'>There are two key things to focus on in order to improve the quality of your relationship:</p><ol className='content_ol'><li>Learn how to handle conflict together</li><li>Understand and accept each other</li></ol><p>We will cover conflict in depth in the next section.</p><p>After the Conflict section, the rest of the guide focuses on understanding and accepting each other. We'll explain the dynamics created by your differences in personality, and offer advice on how to handle each dynamic.</p><p>On this page, we are going to explain some <u>vital</u> concepts. They are mindset shifts. Viewing the guide through this lens will help you make the biggest possible improvements in your relationship.</p><h3>Neither of you is 'right'</h3><p>Throughout the guide, you will encounter places where you and your partner have different personalities.</p><p>For instance, many couples have one organized partner and one messy partner.</p><p>Neither partner is 'right'.</p><p>You see the world in a certain way, and probably think that everyone else sees it the same way... but they don't. Your partner sees it another way, and how they see things makes <i>just as much sense to them</i> as your way does to you.</p><blockquote><i>\"We see people and things not as they are, but as we are. That is why when two people look at something or someone, you get two different reactions.\"</i><br/> - Anthony De Mello, <i>Awareness</i></blockquote><p>It's easy to view the other person's point of view as flawed since it's not the same as yours. It's easy to think about what your partner 'should' do and how they 'should' think. Which, of course, is how you think and behave. Funny coincidence, huh?</p><p>But both of your personality styles are equally valid. One is not better than the other.</p><h3>Don't expect your partner to change</h3><p>Many people have the fantasy that if only their partner would change XYZ thing, that everything would suddenly be great.</p><p>Unfortunately, it doesn't work like that.</p><p>Wanting your partner to change is a recipe for disaster. It doesn't work. Because 99% of the time, they don't change. And trying to make them change actually makes things worse.</p><blockquote><i>\"Love is the experience of fully accepting someone as they are right now.\"</i></blockquote><p>If you love your partner with the expectation that they will change, you don't love them. Full stop.</p><p>It's important to accept your partner as they are, with zero expectation that any of their flaws will ever go away. And to love them anyway.</p><p>You and your partner won't change, but you <i>can</i> change the <i>dynamics</i> of how you interact. And <i>that</i> can change everything.</p><h3>Most of your problems will never go away</h3><p>Research suggests that 76% of couples' fights are about recurring problems that stem from core personality differences.</p><p>This is actually good news. Once you understand your core differences, accept your partner's way of being as just as valid as yours, and make small adjustments accordingly, these recurring fights will happen much less often - if ever.</p><h3>Acceptance is fundamental</h3><p>So, your partner is different from you. Their point of view and personality is just as valid as yours. Everything they do makes as much sense to them as everything you do makes sense to you. And they aren't going to change.</p><p>Your only path forward is acceptance.</p><p><b>Your relationship will never improve until you accept your partner as they are, with no expectation of them ever changing.</b> The same goes for your partner accepting you.</p><p>It's easy to 'accept' your partner while still secretly holding on to your ideas of what they 'should' do.</p><p>'Should' is a one-way road to misery. The more you remove 'shoulds' from your thinking, the more your life and relationship will improve.</p><p className='research_remove_paragraph_bottom_margin'>As you read the guide, focus on:</p><ol className='content_ol'><li>Stepping outside yourself and understanding your partner's point of view and way of being</li><li>Accepting it as just as 'correct' as your way of being</li><li>Accepting that it will never change</li></ol><p>This acceptance is the basis for all love. And it's the best way forward.</p><h3>'Should' is a four-letter word</h3><p>Everybody has values. We all have beliefs about what makes a good person good.</p><p>An example of one of these beliefs would be, \"If one person in the family is struggling financially, and another is making a lot of money, then the person making lots of money should help out the person struggling. That's what good people do.\"</p><p>Can you spot the issue here?</p><p>The issue <i>isn't</i> the point of view. It's a perfectly valid point of view that many people have.</p><p><b>The issue is the \"that's what good people do.\" That's because it implies that the point of view is a <i>universal truth.</i> It implies that 'everyone agrees' that that is what good people do. It implies that this point of view is objectively right, and other points of view are objectively wrong.</b></p><p>Therefore if you have money and don't help out family, you're a bad person. And my job is to show you the error in your thinking so that you realize that  you're wrong and I'm right. Right?</p><p>Well, no.</p><p>The issue is that this is <i>not</i> a universal value. Some people believe that unless the family member in question is in a really tight spot, helping them learn to fish for themselves is actually the more loving action.</p><p>The question here is not, \"which person is right?\" Neither is right, neither is wrong. They are both valid. They both make sense to the people that believe them.</p><p className='research_remove_paragraph_bottom_margin'>Rather, the point is</p><ul className='content_ol'><li>Recognizing that not everyone shares your worldview. It's recognizing that people don't all agree on what a good person \"should\" do.</li><li>Recognizing that your partner <i>may not even know</i> what your worldview is.</li><li>Recognizing that if your partner doesn't act how you think they \"should\" act, that doesn't mean that they are a bad person.</li><li>Recognizing that your partner's point of view is as valid as yours (crazy, right?!).</li></ul><p className='research_remove_paragraph_bottom_margin'>Let's imagine a conflict based on this example. </p><ul className='content_ol'><li className='li_style_bullet'>\"I'm really hurt that you've got all this money but don't help me out. I'm over here struggling and I feel like you just don't care. Family helps out family, that's what people do.\"</li></ul><p className='research_remove_paragraph_bottom_margin'>This the pattern we want to break. Instead, say:</p><ul className='content_ol'><li className='li_style_bullet'>\"I'm feeling hurt that you've got all this money but don't help me out. I'm over here struggling and I feel like you just don't care.</li><li className='li_style_bullet'>One of my core beliefs is that family helps out family in situations like this. It's what I believe good people do. But... as crazy as it seems to me, I realize you don't share that value, and I'd like to understand how you think about it.\"</li></ul><p>This is the shift you want to make: talking about it as your core value and then asking the other person to help you understand <i>their</i> value.</p><p>It goes beyond this one example. Our lives are full of beliefs about what people 'should' do. </p><p>But these 'shoulds' that we have are not actually based on objective reality. They are based on our own values and personalities, on the family and culture in which we grew up, on our education and our life experience.</p><p>We believe our partner should share these values, and this belief becomes an expectation about how our partner should act. And then we get upset when they don't act that way. And then try to change them.</p><p>Making this perspective shift will take some practice.</p><p>For now, just remind yourself that the values that are so obvious to you aren't actually universal. That your partner may have different values and still be a good person. And to ask what their values are, before getting upset at them for not acting in accordance with yours.</p><blockquote><i>\"Dreams are never the same for any two people. In a relationship, we can pretend to be the same, to think the same, to feel the same, to dream the same, but there is no way that can happen. There are two dreamers with two dreams. Every dreamer is going to dream in his own way. That is why we need to accept the differences that exist between two dreamers; we need to respect each other’s dream.\"</i></br>- Don Miguel Ruiz</blockquote><h3>It takes time</h3><p>While most couples experience some big improvements almost right away, other things take more time.</p><p>If you find you have issues that are really stuck, our coaching is a good way to help you get unstuck.</p><h3>Talk about it</h3><p>At the end of the guide, we have a section called \"What's Next\".</p><p>In it, we'll explain how to have productive conversations with your partner about the guide, in a way that will make the quickest impact on the quality of your relationship, and in a way that will help either side avoid getting defensive.</p><h3>Short and to the point</h3><p>We intentionally keep the guide as brief as possible.</p><p>The advice is short and concise, but don't let the length fool you. In every paragraph there is a lot of information that can have a huge impact on improving your relationship quality, when you stop to think everything through carefully.</p><p>Reading it is just the first step. The real progress comes from talking it through with your partner, and from working on the things that the guide brings to your attention.</p>",
        GUIDES_ROMANTIC_REPORT_CONFLICT_DESC: "<p>Research suggests that how a couple handles conflict is <i>the</i> most important thing in determining their chances of success. That's because every couple has conflicts - even those who have been happily married for decades. Often, happy couples argue about the same things over and over for years - what researchers call 'perpetual problems'.</p><p>Since every relationship will involve conflict, how those conflicts are handled is vitally important. Two couples with the same problem will get vastly different outcomes based on how well they handle the conflict.</p><p>Therapists and society generally claim there's a 'right' way to handle conflict. Fortunately and unfortunately, in the context of relationships, that's simply not true. What therapists recommend you do could work with one partner, and piss another off.</p><p>What is actually important is the particular <i>combination</i> of conflict styles in the relationship. What are the dynamics created when you put your conflict style into a relationship with your partner's style?</p><p>In many cases, the best way to handle conflict flies in the face of traditional advice.</p><p>In our Couple's Guide, we give <i>advice</i> to couples based on their conflict styles. We explain <i>how</i> to better handle conflict, given their personalities.</p><p>That's not what you'll find here in the Romantic Compatibility Guide. In this guide, the idea is to give you a <i>preview</i> of what the dynamics would normally be like - a sense of what to expect.</p><p>Will it be difficult or problematic? Are you very different? What will you have to accept about your partner's conflict style? Are you prepared to accept it? Could conflict be manageable with this person with proper guidance, or will it always be very difficult?</p><p>While change is certainly possible, it's not likely. When entering a relationship, it's important to accept your partner as they are, assuming they will never change. As you read this page, ask yourself - does this sound like something I could be comfortable with in the long term?</p>",

You don't need to answer them all, they're just to get you going.</p><ul className='content_ul'><li>Do you feel the description of your conflict style is accurate?</p></li><li>Are there values or a deeper reason why you handle conflict the way you do?</li><li>Do you wish you handled it differently, or are you comfortable with how you handle conflict?</li><li>Are there any emotions around how you handle conflict?</li><li>Is there anything you feel people 'should' do or 'should not' do in conflict? <i>(This question is a good way to get at the values behind how you handle conflict.

It's the longest section of the guide.</p><p>How you handle conflict in your relationship determines its trajectory. Is it going to get better and better, or worse and worse?</p><p>Research suggests that how well a couple handles conflict together is <i>the</i> most important factor in determining how happy they are (and how likely they are to break up).</p><p>Improving how you handle conflict together is the closest thing to a magic wand that exists in relationships.</p><p>But, as we mentioned before, traditional advice is not very good - in part because it's one-size-fits-all.</p><p>Your individual conflict styles are important, but what really matters is the dynamic created in a relationship when you put each of your styles together. What we've written is specific to the two of you.</p><p>The advice we give on this page might be contrary to what you've heard before. But trust us. Try it out. It's backed by a combination of research and decades of experience working with tens of thousands of people.</p><p>If you find you disagree with something here, think it over for a few days. Often, you'll disagree with something, only to realize a day later, \"Huh, that really <i>was</i> correct.\"</p><p>The advice here is written for couples with your two conflict styles. Even though it's very specific, even couples with the same pairing may struggle with some things more than others. If we give advice on how to handle something that isn't a big issue for you, that's great news, and you can just read it and move on.</p><blockquote><i>\"Difficult conversations are almost never about getting the facts right. They are about conflicting perceptions, interpretations, and values.</i>\"<br/>- Douglas Stone, Harvard University</blockquote><p>There are two broad groups of conflicts: </p><p><ol className='content_ol'><li>Things that can be solved. By following the advice on this page and in the What's Next? section, you'll be able to resolve many of your ongoing conflicts and handle most conflicts much better.</li><li>Things that can't be solved. Some conflicts are due to personality differences between you that will likely never go away. These simply don't have solutions.<br/><br/>But that's OK - the same is true of couples who have been happily married for 50 years. Every couple has these ongoing problems that don't get solved, and trying desperately to solve them can actually do more harm than good.<br/><br/>Handling these conflicts better doesn't necessarily mean finding a solution, which may be impossible. Rather, it means making the problem less painful, making it cause less upset, making it less of an issue. <i>This</i> is achievable, even if the problem is never truly 'solved'.<br/><br/><b>Thus, improving how you handle conflict will improve your relationship even if the problems themselves don't actually get solved.</b></li></ol></p><p>And improving how you handle conflict doesn't just remove the remove the negative in your relationship. Perhaps surprisingly, improving how you handle conflict actually opens the relationship up to be filled with much more love, understanding, acceptance, and magic. </p><p>With all that said, let's dive in.</p>",

        OUR_MODEL_SIDE_NAV_2:"The 14 Themes",
        OUR_MODEL_SIDE_NAV_2_DESC:"<p>We didn't pick these themes. We found them in our data. They are clear patterns that emerged in our research.</p><p>In the process of building the model, we discovered some things that go against popular thought about personality. For instance, it's often said that introverts are creative daydreamers. But we found that those are independent of each other - they are different themes. Being an introvert does not mean you are a daydreamer or more creative. Likewise, being performance-driven and goal-oriented doesn't mean you don't deeply crave emotional connection.</p><p>Thus, each of these themes are independent of each other.</p><p>The following is a summary of each of the themes, and each of the styles in each theme. <b>These summaries are simplified</b> - in reality, there is an incredible amount of nuance in each style that we don't dive into here, as it would be too long.</p><h3>☀️ Altruism</h3><p>Are you emotionally pulled to help others? Or do you only genuinely care about your own inner circle? Does anything get in the way of you being able to help others?</p><p><b>Style 1</b></p><p>These people are altruistic. They are driven on an emotional level to help people - everyone, not just those close to them. It's not a burden for them, but a source of satisfaction.</p><p><b>Style 2</b></p><p>These people only <i>genuinely</i> care about those close to them. When they help people outside of their inner circle, it comes from a rational place of wanting to make the maximum difference possible, not from an emotional pull at their heartstrings.</p><p><b>Style 3</b></p><p>These people's problems are emotionally draining for them. They care a lot about others, but if they are dealing with their own problems, those end up taking up their energy. Because of this, some people may misunderstand them and think that these people are selfish.</p><h3>😑 Conflict</h3><p>How do you handle conflict? Do you run away from conflict, strive for harmony, or do you not mind a good fight? When your back is against the wall, are you willing to lie or manipulate?</p><p>This is one of the most important themes, particularly for interpersonal relationships.</p><p><b>Style 1</b></p><p>These people have high emotional intelligence. In conflict, they use their social skills to bring harmony to the situation, get to the bottom of the problem, and find a win-win solution. </p><p><b>Style 2</b></p><p>These people are like style 1, but instead of being primarily driven by maintaining harmony, they are driven by <i>performance</i>. They constantly push themselves to get to the next level.</p><p><b>Style 3</b></p><p>These people are also like style 1, but really dislike conflict and try to avoid it. When they have something they want to talk to someone about, it creates an internal dilemma: they don't want to cause conflict by bringing the issue up, but if they don't, the issue just festers.</p><p><b>Style 4</b></p><p>These people avoid conflict. They prefer to stay in their comfort zone, only dealing with uncomfortable conversations when really necessary. When conflicts do come up, they are comfortable letting others take the lead.</p><p><b>Style 5</b></p><p>Like style 3 and 4, these people prefer to avoid conflict. They aren't as good at resolving conflict and restoring harmony as those in style 1, but they can definitely get the job done.</p><p><b>Style 6</b></p><p>In contrast to the first five styles, these people don't shy away from conflict. In conflict, they respect others and are cooperative. They value <i>honesty</i> over <i>harmony,</i> however. If something bothers them, they say so. Not sharing how they feel would feel dishonest to them. Sometimes, they might upset the other person by being 'too honest.'</p><p>If things seem to be going nowhere, they may tell the other person what they want to hear so they stop giving them grief.</p><p><b>Style 7</b></p><p>This group is generally good at handling conflict, but when emotions run high, they might explode - as many people do when pushed. They may say and do things they later regret, because they don't know what else to do. </p><p><b>Style 8</b></p><p>These people are confident that they know the best way to do things and generally want things done their way. When people disagree with them, they'll likely have no issue taking control and doing what they believe necessary to ensure things get done right. They do a lot for those close to them, and expect loyalty in return.</p><h3>🥰 Emotions</h3><p>Do you crave deep emotional connection with others? Are emotions a guiding force in your life, or does that statement not even make sense to you?</p><p><b>Style 1</b></p><p>Emotions are important to these people. They're a guiding influence in their lives. However, they are more emotionally guarded than some. They might not be fully comfortable expressing what they feel. That might be why they tend to see things in terms of actions and results, more than feelings.</p><p><b>Style 2</b></p><p>These people aren't very emotionally expressive. They might even be confused why other people put so much emphasis on feelings. They still form strong bonds with people, but they aren't based on deep emotional connection.</p><p><b>Style 3</b></p><p>In contrast to style 2, these people connect with others primarily through feelings. Deep emotional connection is important to them in all areas of their life, and especially in romantic relationships. The idea that many others don't connect primarily through feelings may even be inconceivable to them.</p><p><b>Style 4</b></p><p>These people are comfortable with emotions, but aren't ruled by them. They aren't afraid of showing their own emotions, and while they are aware of others' emotions, they don't really get overwhelmed by them. Simply put, they are emotionally stable.</p><h3>💬 Extroversion</h3><p>Do you love being around other people? Do you need social interaction to be happy? Are you comfortable in social situations? Do you need 'alone time'?</p><p><b>Extroverts</b></p><p>These people are extroverts. They love socializing and feel energized after spending time with friends. Contrary to popular belief, extroverts aren't necessarily party animals. Sure, for these people, big social events are fun. They like people. But what is actually important to them is enjoying time with friends.</p><p><b>Ambiverts</b></p><p>These people are ambiverts. They like being social and are comfortable around people. When they socialize, they prefer smaller groups where they can actually talk to everyone. But unlike extroverts, they don't need as much social time and are equally happy being alone.</p><p><b>Introverts</b></p><p>These people are introverts. They enjoy spending time by themselves and often like to be left alone. That said, they do have a small number of close friends. They prefer socializing in small groups where they know everybody, or one-on-one.  Big groups can be too much for them. When they meet someone new, it takes time for them to get fully comfortable and open up.</p><h3>🏔 Drivers</h3><p>What motivates you in life? What are your priorities - is it family, career, prestige?</p><p><b>Style 1</b></p><p>These people are efficient and are always looking to improve the way they do things. Career is important to them. That said, friendships and happiness are more important to them than results. Interestingly, for these people, friendships are about achieving things together. Family is also one of the most important things to them.</p><p><b>Style 2</b></p><p>These people are similar to those in style 1, but they don't think friendships are about achieving things together, and family is slightly less important. These people also care more about being happy and feeling good than external signals like money, looking good to others, and prestige.</p><p><b>Style 3</b></p><p>These people like to lead others. They'd rather be in control than told what to do. They also like to stand out, and be recognized for their success. While they do care about their family, it doesn't play as central of a role in their life as it does for some people.</p><p><b>Style 4</b></p><p>While others have particular drivers that motivate them, these people are more flexible. It's not that they are unmotivated. They just sort of do their thing, one step at a time, with no need for fanfare. They don't strive for prestige, promotions, or leadership positions. They aren't uncomfortable being leaders, but it's not a goal of theirs.</p><p><b>Style 5</b></p><p>These people are motivated by family, community and relationships rather than power, fame, or material success. If they have children, they are an essential source of meaning in their life. And if they don't, they likely channel their nurturing nature onto something else - like a garden, pets, or community project. Social interactions for them don't have a goal. Unlike some, they are fully present, enjoying each little moment.</p><p><b>Style 6</b></p><p>These people care more about money and status than most. That said, these things still aren't <i>that</i> important to them. It's not a defining factor of their personality.</p><h3>🛣 Goals & Energy</h3><p>Are you goal-oriented, or prefer to go with the flow? Do you have the energy to pursue what you want in life, or do you need a push?</p><p><b>Style 1</b></p><p>These people are goal-oriented. They know their goals and work hard to achieve them. They invest in their personal growth, take accountability, and follow through on their decisions. This is so automatic for them that they may be surprised to find that many people don't have goals and aren't working towards anything.</p><p><b>Style 2</b></p><p>These people are very similar to those in style 1, but even harder working. They are very future-oriented, and like to plan in advance so they are ready for anything. They tend to do even more than asked of them.</p><p><b>Style 3</b></p><p>Like the first two styles, these people are future-oriented. They have dreams for their life and future, which they think about all the time. But they just can't seem to find the energy to put in the work necessary to actually achieve your vision. They feel stuck, and it's disheartening for them. They'd  appreciate having the support of someone to keep them on track.</p><p><b>Style 4</b></p><p>These people are generally happy to just chill.</p><p>They do better in structured environments where there is clear guidance on what to do when. This structure gives them motivation. They know what to do and can focus on doing it. It's hard for them to be motivated when it's not clear what they should be doing.</p><p><b>Style 5</b></p><p>While some people spend lots of time thinking about the future, these people are more relaxed. They don't struggle with motivation, and have enough energy to pursue the things they care about. But they aren't workaholics. Instead, they get things done at a steady pace.</p><h3>🧽 Organization</h3><p>Do you keep your home clean and organized, or is it a mess? Do you even notice the mess in the first place?</p><p><b>Style 1</b></p><p>It's important to these people to be organized. They always put things back where they belong. They also generally prefer to do things according to a plan.</p><p><b>Style 2</b></p><p>These people don't care if their home is messy or neat. It's not that they are lazy, it's just not that important to them. In fact, they usually <i>don't even notice</i> when there is a mess.</p><h3>🧗 Risk</h3><p>Does skydiving sound like fun? Or are you more cautious? How do you handle your finances?</p><p><b>Style 1</b></p><p>Nearly everyone likes to travel, but for these people, it's even more important. Spontaneous, exciting adventures energize them. They aren't obsessive about planning every little detail ahead of time. They are willing to take risks.</p><p><b>Style 2</b></p><p>These people are generally cautious, particularly in romantic relationships. They can be counted on to follow rules and procedures. They don't like reckless, extreme, or dangerous activities. This doesn't make them boring, they just get their satisfaction in other ways.</p><p><b>Style 3</b></p><p>These people are in between the first two groups. You probably won't find them skydiving, but they also aren't particularly cautious.</p><h3>🎨 Thinking Style</h3><p>Do you need to have a creative outlet? Do you daydream, playing with abstract ideas, or are you more concrete?</p><p><b>Style 1</b></p><p>These are a highly creative people that love to get lost in thought, create things, and have intellectual and philosophical discussions. Having a creative outlet is very important to them.</p><p><b>Style 2</b></p><p>These people are practical. They are less interested in abstract ideas, instead focusing on what is concrete.</p><h3>🛫 Variety</h3><p>Do you need to have lots of new experiences, or are you comfortable doing the same things over and over?</p><p><b>Style 1</b></p><p>Most people think of variety as a preference, a nice to have. But as it turns out, it's not. For these people, variety and new experiences are a <i>need</i>. New experiences energize them. If they did the same thing every day, they would become deeply unhappy. That doesn't necessarily mean that they <i>constantly</i> need those new experiences. Everyone has an ideal balance.</p><p><b>Style 2</b></p><p>While these people aren't necessarily against variety or trying new things, it's really not that important to them. They are perfectly happy to do the same things and see the same people over and over. They like routines in their day-to-day, and it works for them.</p><h3>📋 Rules</h3><p>Do you rebel against authority? Do you find rules restricting and boring, or calming?</p><p><b>Style 1</b></p><p>For these people, rules represent a box that is not only limiting, but inherently <i>boring</i>. They prefer to do things their own way.</p><p><b>Style 2</b></p><p>These people respect authority and follow the rules. Whether it's at work or in their personal life, they prefer that others follow the rules too.</p><p><b>Style 3</b></p><p>While some people like rules and order and others are more rebellious, these people don't really care either way. They are flexible and will get on fine with both kinds of people.</p><h3>🔬 Perfectionism</h3><p>Are you a perfectionist?</p><p><b>Style 1</b></p><p>It's important to these people to do excellent work. To do things really well. They detect mistakes and want every detail taken care of. Taken to an extreme, these people are perfectionists.</p><p><b>Style 2</b></p><p>Little mistakes don't drive these people crazy. They care about quality work, but they won't keep pushing and pushing until everything is perfect.</p><h3>📚 Learning</h3><p>Do you love learning? If you aren't learning something new, do you feel like your 'brain is dying'? Do you hate when people push you?</p><p><b>Style 1</b></p><p>These people have a thirst to learn. If they're not learning something new, they may feel like their 'brain is dying'. They like being in environments that challenge them to get better and better every day.</p><p>So whether it's a stack of books, picking up a new skill like cooking, or practicing an existing hobby to get better at it, these people will be happiest when they are learning something new on a regular basis.</p><p><b>Style 2</b></p><p>These people have high standards and are constantly learning, pushing themselves to be at the cutting edge of anything they do. People are an especially important part of this process for them. Much of their drive is directed towards learning to improve their relationships. For them, people are a source of mutual support and growth.</p><p><b>Style 3</b></p><p>These people don't like it when others point out their flaws and push them to change. While they may have plenty of things they would like to improve in their life, they aren't as focused on self development and learning as some.</p>",
        OUR_MODEL_SIDE_NAV_3:"Is One Personality Better Than Others?",
        OUR_MODEL_SIDE_NAV_3_DESC:"<h3>Different, not better</h3><p>Many people read their profile and think, \"Is it positive things for everybody or just me?\"</p><p>Your Interpersonality profile describes how you think and see the world. The way you see things seems obvious to you, and most people assume that everyone else sees things the same way. Since your worldview seems obvious and correct to you, when your profile describes your worldview back to you, it seems positive.</p><p>But your personality isn't positive or negative. Each individual style is a set of <i>characteristics</i> that come with both good and bad, depending on whose opinion you ask and on the context. What you see as a positive, someone else may see as a negative. What works in one situation may derail you in another.</p><p>For instance, goal-oriented people reading about that part of themselves will see it as overwhelmingly positive. But if they marry someone who prefers to just chill, their spouse will likely find it annoying and want them to turn it off and just <i>be</i> with them.</p><p>Your way of viewing the world is not the 'correct' way. Other people think differently, and their point of view makes just as much sense to them as yours does to you. There is no 'right' personality. </p><p>Once you understand this, it becomes much easier to accept others exactly as they are. And accepting someone as they are dramatically improves your relationship with them.</p><h3>Correlations with life outcomes</h3><p>That all said, some styles <i>do</i> correlate more strongly with positive life outcomes - being happy, having great relationships, etc.</p><p>An additional theme that we didn't list above is Life Outcomes. Basically, are you happy? Do your relationships turn out well? Do you have anxiety and fear?</p><p>There are 8 styles in the Life Outcomes theme. Since these don't really describe your personality, we left them out above.</p><p>But correlation is not causation. While some personalities are more likely than others to be happy and have great relationships, that doesn't mean that the other personalities aren't as good or <i>can't</i> be equally happy and successful. It just means that statistically, certain personality styles tend to correlate with happiness.</p><h2>👥 Interpersonal</h2><p>Having a stunningly accurate personality test is interesting, for sure.</p><p>By learning about yourself, you can make life and relationship choices that match who you truly are. Maybe your personality results even 'give you permission' to be yourself.</p><p><b>But the biggest benefit of Interpersonality is not from reading your own profile.</b></p><p>It's using it to learn about your friends, family, coworkers, and romantic partner - and <b>to improve your relationships.</b></p><p>After you take the test, you can view the profile of your friends or anyone you have the private profile link for. With each of them, there's a special section on their profile where you can see your two personalities side-by-side and compare them to learn where you're similar and different. It's called <i>Interpersonal</i>, which means 'between people'. That's where our name comes from.</p><p>You also see a Similarity Score<sup><b>TM</b></sup> with them - a percentage of how similar your personalities are.</p><p>You'll find that after reading the Interpersonal page, you'll understand the other person more clearly than ever before. Many things will suddenly make sense.</p><p>When you understand and accept others for who they are, it's incredible how much your relationships can improve overnight.</p><p><b>That's the real goal of Interpersonality - to help you improve your relationships.</b></p>",

It's statistically validated and accurate, but it doesn't really tell you much.</p><p>Interpersonality changes that.</p><p>We have built on top of the Big Five.</p><p>Our personality test uses 120 questions that assess Big Five traits with six facets within each of the Big Five, a total of 30 facets. Our questionnaire uses the public domain 120 questions developed by John Johnson, Professor Emeritus of Psychology, Pennsylvania State University, presented in his paper <a target='_blank' href='https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0092656614000506?via%3Dihub'>\"Measuring thirty facets of the Five Factor Model with a 120-item public domain inventory: Development of the IPIP-NEO-120</a>\" and shared on The <b><a href='https://ipip.ori.org/30FacetNEO-PI-RItems.htm' target='_blank'>International Personality Item Pool (IPIP)</a></b> site.</p><p>This gives us a scientific base to work from.</p><p>To build our model, we gave 163,000 people these 120 Big Five questions, plus age and gender, and then continued to ask them <i>additional</i> questions.</p><p>These additional questions were the 9,000 personality descriptions mentioned at the beginning of this page, ranging from how someone acted after a breakup, to how they prefer to communicate with their boss, to what kind of vacations they take.</p><p>This data was what we built our personality model from.</p><p>Essentially, we have taken the Big Five, and through our research, actually made it useful by mapping the thirty Big Five traits to <i>how they play out for people</i> in the most important areas of their lives: romance, conflict, work, thinking styles, and lifestyle.</p><p>It's impossible for a <i>person</i> to predict what someone's personality is from just looking at their raw trait scores, let alone all of its nuance. That's because the 30 traits are information in isolation, and it's how specific combinations interact that is important. Our model's advanced AI could handle this complexity, allowing us to discover patterns that are not at all obvious.

        OUR_MODEL_SIDE_NAV_5:"The Barnum Effect",
        OUR_MODEL_SIDE_NAV_5_DESC:"<p>A common question we get about our personality model is, \"how do you know you aren't saying things that everyone would agree with?\"</p><p>To answer this, let us share a story.</p><p><p><blockquote className='ourmodel_blockquote'><i>In 1948, in what has been described as a \"classic experiment\", psychologist Bertram R. Forer gave a psychology test – his so-called \"Diagnostic Interest Blank\" – to 39 of his psychology students, who were told that they would each receive a brief personality vignette or sketch based on their test results. One week later Forer gave each student a purportedly individualized sketch and asked each of them to rate it on how well it applied. In reality, each student received the same sketch, consisting of the following items:</p><p>1. You have a great need for other people to like and admire you.</p><p>2. You have a tendency to be critical of yourself.</p><p>3. You have a great deal of unused capacity which you have not turned to your advantage.</p><p>4. While you have some personality weaknesses, you are generally able to compensate for them.</p><p>5. Your sexual adjustment has presented problems for you.</p><p>6. Disciplined and self-controlled outside, you tend to be worrisome and insecure inside.</p><p>7. At times you have serious doubts as to whether you have made the right decision or done the right thing.</p><p>8. You prefer a certain amount of change and variety and become dissatisfied when hemmed in by restrictions and limitations.</p><p>9. You pride yourself as an independent thinker and do not accept others' statements without satisfactory proof.</p><p>10. You have found it unwise to be too frank in revealing yourself to others.</p>11. At times you are extroverted, affable, sociable, while at other times you are introverted, wary, reserved.</p><p>12. Some of your aspirations tend to be pretty unrealistic.</p><p>13. Security is one of your major goals in life.</p><p>On average, the students rated its accuracy as 4.30 on a scale of 0 (very poor) to 5 (excellent). Only after the ratings were turned in was it revealed that each student had received an identical sketch assembled by Forer from a newsstand astrology book.</i> -<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnum_effect' target='_blank'> Wikipedia</a></blockquote></p></p><p>If you're like most people, you probably agree with the 12 statements above. This is due to the \"Barnum effect\":</p><p><blockquote className='ourmodel_blockquote'><i>The Barnum effect is a common psychological phenomenon whereby individuals give high accuracy ratings to descriptions of their personality that supposedly are tailored specifically to them, that are in fact vague and general enough to apply to a wide range of people.</i> -<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnum_effect' target='_blank'> Wikipedia</a></blockquote></p><p>If you have taken another personality test, and felt that it was pretty accurate, there's a good chance that part of the reason you agreed with it was because of the Barnum effect. </p><p>So, the question \"how do you know you aren't saying things that everyone would agree with?\" is a good one.</p><h3>Making things distinctive</h3><p>We are very aware of this effect. Instead of using it to ensure people artificially agreed with their personality profile, we avoided it. We focus on what is truly different between people. What makes you <i>you</i>, not what makes everyone a human being. </p><p>After we gathered data for the 9,000 personality descriptions, we filtered them. We ignored any descriptions that everyone agreed with in order to make sure that we only talked about things that were distinctive.</p><p>We avoid saying things that everyone would agree with, because the whole point is for others to understand you and you to understand others, in order to improve your relationships. If your profile was just feel-good fluff, it wouldn't be very helpful.</p><p>Thus, everything you read in your profile is specific to you.</p>",

You are able to opt-out of this when registering for an account with Interpersonality, and can remove this permission at any time under the Privacy page of the website. Please see the Facebook privacy policy for details.</p><p>We also use <b>Google Analytics</b>, which allows us to track the same things as Snowplow. This data is securely stored in remote servers in the United States.</p><p>Next, we use <b>ChartIO</b>, a platform that allows us to more easily analyze the contents of our database. It's used by companies like Udemy, WePay and AirAsia, and is very secure: <a href = \"https://chartio.com/product/security/\" target = '_blank'>https://chartio.com/product/security/</a>.

        COLLABORATE_ON_RESEARCH_TITLE: "Collaborate on Research",
        COLLABORATE_ON_RESEARCH_DESC: "<p>We collaborate with academic researchers, respected authors, and other thought leaders to conduct original research on the psychology of personality.</p><p>Historically, a major limitation for psychometric researchers has been access to good data sets. Many researchers have to settle for surveying a few hundred students studying psychology or related topics at their university. These samples are often too small for strong statistical validity, and are biased as they often use self-selected populations with specific demographics and interests.</p><p><b>We are on a mission to change this</b> by making large survey samples with less selection bias available to researchers.</p><h3>How it Works</h3><p>Our personality test uses 120 questions that assess Big Five traits with six facets within each of the Big Five, a total of 30 facets. Our questionnaire uses the public domain 120 questions developed by John Johnson, Professor Emeritus of Psychology, Pennsylvania State University, presented in his paper <a href='https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0092656614000506?via%3Dihub' target=\"_blank\">\"Measuring thirty facets of the Five Factor Model with a 120-item public domain inventory: Development of the IPIP-NEO-120\"</a> and shared on The <a href='https://ipip.ori.org/30FacetNEO-PI-RItems.htm' target=\"_blank\">International Personality Item Pool (IPIP)</a> site.</p><p>To conduct research, after visitors to our site have completed Johnson's 120-question Big Five survey, we present them with additional, optional questions. These questions are generally single sentences or short paragraphs that the user may agree or disagree with on a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likert_scale' target=\"_blank\">Likert scale</a> of -3 to +3, for example, \"I have a written plan for my life\". For each of these additional questions, we typically collect 1,000 responses. The exact number of responses can be adjusted to ensure statistical validity depending on the requirements of the current research project.</p><p>We also collect age, gender, geographic location and language preference (currently English and Spanish are supported).</p><p>This allows us to collect large volumes of survey data for Big Five traits (and thirty facets), demographic data and responses to the questions we are currently researching. At the time of writing (October 7, 2020), we have surveyed 167,322 people and received 16,993,597 responses to 9,394 research questions.</p><p><b>These additional questions are how we are able to support ongoing research.</b> As we can add any questions we like to the additional questions, we can support any legitimate and ethical research into the relationships between Big Five traits, demographics and other factors ranging from lifestyle, family and romantic relationships, career path, life outcomes, etc.</p><p>We are eager to collaborate with academic researchers, respected authors, and other thought leaders to conduct original research together.</p><p>If your research interest is a good fit, we would:</p><ol className=\"collaborate_on_reasearch\"><li>Work with you to write the additional questions that we would ask our users, and establish the number of responses needed for statistical validity. We have the capability to test large numbers of questions quickly.</li><li>Collect the required number of responses to each question from users around the world.</li><li>Analyze the results with you and publish a paper with you about the findings. This analysis and the process of writing the paper we can do with you if you are an academic researcher, or on your behalf if you are less familiar with psychometrics and statistical analysis. We would generally publish a summary of the research results on our blog, and encourage you to publish the results elsewhere.</li></ol><p><b>Collaborating with us on research has no cost.</b> We are a research-first company, and research collaboration is both part of our mission and a way to give back.</p><p>While we cannot say yes to everyone who requests to do research with us, we do consider and reply to each request.</p><p>If you are interested in collaborating on research, please contact <a href='mailto:research@interpersonality.com'>research@interpersonality.com</a>.</p>",

        RESEARCH_ARTICLE_ABSTRACT_CONTENT: "<p>Our research objective was to build a novel personality type model that is comprehensive in the range of human psychology it covers, simple to understand, and statistically validated for accuracy. We surveyed 144,164 individuals, who completed standard Big Five tests (input variables). We also collected respondents' responses to 9,394 descriptions, covering a wide range of personality and behavioral topics (output variables). In total, we collected 16,181,276 ratings of output variables.  Using these data, we applied various machine learning approaches to develop a novel personality type model. We discovered that historical concepts of personality type cannot be used to develop a comprehensive and statistically sound personality type model. In order to be comprehensive and have enough detail to be insightful, the number of personality types needed was much too large. Instead, in our model resulting from this research, we identified 14 separate personality themes (e.g. Extraversion, Conflict, Emotions) with between 2 and 8 styles within each theme. Each person's personality is made up of their style in each of the 14 themes. This allows for great detail and insight while still being simple enough to understand. In total, there are 29,859,840 potential combinations of styles. The ability to generate about 30 million personality reports matches the complexity of human personality better than existing models, which typically only generate reports covering 16 personality types.</p>",

        RESEARCH_ARTICLE_DMCM: "2.1 Dichotomous Models vs. Continuous Models",
        RESEARCH_ARTICLE_DMCM_CONTENT: "<p>Almost all personality type models use four personality traits to construct their personality type models, so in this section, we'll assume the personality type model has four traits. (The traits used in different models to construct their personality types differ widely, but almost all models use four traits.)<br><br>A few personality models, such as DiSC, provide trait score results on a continuous scale. (Although with the caveat that DiSC uses an ipsative scale, which we discuss below.)<br><br>However, most personality models form their type system by dividing people into one or other extreme of a trait - above or below some cutoff point of the trait score in that dimension. For example, MBTI<sup>®</sup> classifies people into Extraverted <u>or</u> Introverted. They then define the different personality types as combinations of one or other of those extremes in each trait dimension.<br><br>With four measured traits in the model, this creates 2<sup>4</sup> = 16 personality types.<br><br>The problem with this approach is that for any measurable personality trait, people fall on roughly normal distributions, with most people being close to the mean, and a few outliers being near the high or low extremes.<ol className=\"research_article_ol\"><li className=\"li_style_none\">For example, see <a href='https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.391.4682&rep=rep1&type=pdf' target='_blank'>Bess & Harvey, 2001</a> for an analysis of the distribution of people across the four MBTI trait scores.</li><li className=\"li_style_none\">Similarly, our own data show roughly normal distributions of scores across the Big Five traits and across all 30 sub-facets of the Big Five.</li></ol>Thus, defining an arbitrary cutoff point between 'high' and 'low' on a trait dimension creates a false dichotomy between types of people. For example, categorizing people into extraverted <u>or</u> introverted and misses the midline 'ambiverts' who are neither highly extraverted nor highly introverted.<br><br>As most people are actually midline on most personality traits, this is a serious shortcoming. It means that most existing models fail to describe most people accurately on most of the trait dimensions the models use.<br><br>Thus, a key objective in our attempt to develop a new personality model was to ensure that the model accounted for the roughly normal distribution of people across trait dimensions, and accurately describe people who fall near the middle of trait dimensions.</p>",

As we used a Likert scale, we were also able to capture and evaluate not only <i>how</i> people liked to be shown affection but also <i>how important</i> being shown affection was to them.<br><br>Dr. Gary Chapman, author of the book The Five Love Languages, explored the same topic, using an ipsative questionnaire.<br><br>After taking Chapman's Love Languages test, people are told that the results give them accurate information on how they most like to be shown affection.<br><br>Technically, that is true. But it misses the forest for the trees.<br><br>Using a Likert questionnaire, we discovered that the biggest distinction between groups of people is that some people really do care about receiving demonstrations of affection, while for others it's just not that important. Among those who do place importance on receiving demonstrations of affection, there is one sub-group that places more importance on physical touch than others, but this distinction was much less marked than the differences between people who do and don't care about receiving demonstrations of affection.<br><br>We found similar patterns when we investigated other themes such as communication styles, leadership styles and negotiation styles. When we compared our results to other tests that covered similar topics using ipsative questionnaires, we generally found that the biggest distinction was whether people cared about the topic or not, and the distinctions drawn from the ipsative tests were much smaller than their personality test results suggest. Some people are great communicators and others are not, but the minusca of their differences in style were less important. Some people like to be leaders and others prefer to follow, but the differences in leadership styles were small compared to their overall preference to lead or follow. Some people have great negotiation skills and others do not, but the differences in the negotiation styles of good negotiators were much less pronounced.<br><br>In general, we conclude that forced ranking tests often produce false distinctions that do not reflect people's real preferences. These tests can indeed be useful and interesting. However, when considering the macro picture of a person's personality, they do not represent significant differences between people.<br><br>Having settled on using a Likert scale for our personality test, the next question was, which personality traits would we measure to build our model?

For example, with the Myers-Briggs test, research has shown that the four traits are not orthogonal, and one of the traits does not even measure opposites, but rather two different things (judging and perceiving) where people can in reality score high for <u>both</u> judging and perceiving but the test does not allow this result. <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2709300/\" target='_blank'>(McCrae and Costa, 1989)</a><br><br>From a data science perspective, using traits that are not orthogonal creates difficult technical problems.

Rolland further advanced the view that the extraversion and agreeableness dimensions are more sensitive to cultural context. Age differences in the five-factors of personality across the adult life span are parallel in samples from Germany, Italy, Portugal, Croatia, and South Korea. Data examined from many different countries have shown that the age and gender differences in those countries resembled differences found in U.S. samples.

        RESEARCH_ARTICLE_STATISTICAL_CRITERIA_FOR_CONTENT:"<p>Once we had identified the 14 themes and their component styles, we needed to write the descriptions for each style.</p><p>To do this, we needed to have statistics on the predicted scores people assigned to each style  would have for each output description used in the theme.</p><p className='research_remove_paragraph_bottom_margin'>To generate these data, we developed a machine learning algorithm that performed the following steps:</p><ol><li>Sample the trait scores of users who had taken our test</li><li>Predict the output score each user would give to each output description used in the theme (using our linear regression models)</li><li>Assign each sample user to a style within the theme</li><li>Assemble summary statistics of the predicted output scores of each output description in the theme for each user assigned to the theme:<ul><li>Mean score of users within the style</li><li>Standard deviation of scores for users within the style</li><li>Difference between the mean score of all users within the style and the mean score of all users not in the style</li></ul></li></ol><p className='research_remove_paragraph_bottom_margin'>This gave us statistics for writing the summary descriptions for each style, whereby we could ensure that:</p><ul><li>What we said about a style was <u>accurate</u></li><li>What we said about a style was <u>distinctive</u> from what we said about other styles</li><li>We had <u>high confidence</u> that what we wrote about a style would be accurate for the vast majority of people assigned to the style</li></ul><p>As a general guideline, we ignored output descriptions that had low differentiation between styles (thus avoiding the Barun Effect), and wrote the style descriptions based on the 84% confidence level of predicted score (one standard deviation from the mean) for people in the style.</p><p>There was one exception to these guidelines. For styles that were truly midline for all of the output descriptions in the theme, we could not write about what was <u>different</u> about them, as they were entirely normal or average. In those cases, we wrote for what would be true of them, even though that would also be true for people in other themes. This allowed us to capture and describe truly midline styles in a way that was statistically meaningful and valid.</p><p>In writing style descriptions, we were rigorous about not interpolating from the <u>data</u> we did have to what our behavioral experts <u>thought</u> would be true of people in that style. There were many long discussions relating our behavioral expertise to the data, where our behavioral expertise would say something like, \"Well, obviously people in this style would also be like X.\" and the data would rebut with \"If there's no data to support it, we cannot assume it and cannot write it.\"</p>",
        RESEARCH_ARTICLE_INFLUENCE_OF_FACTES:"5.6.1.2 Influence of Facets on Style Definitions",
        RESEARCH_ARTICLE_INFLUENCE_OF_FACTES_CONTENT:"<p>In the discussions below, we refer to the 30 facets of the Big Five model. Those facets are defined by the scoring key of the test we use, which you can find <a href='https://ipip.ori.org/30FacetNEO-PI-RItems.htm' target='_blank'>here</a>.</p><p>For each of our styles within each theme, we assembled statistics on the means and standard deviations of facet scores of all people in our sample assigned to the style, plus information about their age and gender. From looking at these mean scores and standard deviations, we can draw some broad conclusions about the relationship between the traits and the style.</p><p>The standard deviation across the mean scores of each facet in each style gives an indication of how influential that facet is in defining the theme. When the standard deviation across the mean scores of a facet across styles is high, it indicates that the machine learning algorithm partitions individuals into styles with high dependence on that facet. When that measure is low, it indicates that that facet does not play an important role in assigning an individual to a facet. </p><p>In the discussion below, when we list the facets that play the most important role in each theme, they are listed in order of the standard deviation of the mean scores of each facet in each style, highest first, so that we show the most influential facets first.</p><p>Having said that, it's important to keep in mind that an individual is assigned to a style based on their entire 30 facet scores plus age and gender, so while some facets play more or less important roles in a theme in <i>general</i>, a specific individual's score may differ greatly from the mean scores in the style.</p><ul><li className='li_style_none'>For example, on average, people in the Assertive style of the Conflict Dynamics theme have higher than average scores for the Depression facet. However, we have a team member who scores very low on the Depression facet but still belongs in the Assertive style - based both on the algorithm that assigns individuals to facets and his own and his colleagues' assessment of his behaviours in regard to this theme.</li></ul><p>Thus, while exploring the facets that have most impact on assigning individuals to styles is illustrative of general patterns, it's important to remember that a person's full 30 facet score plus age and gender are used to actually assign individuals to styles - and individual results can vary quite widely from general patterns.</p>",

        RESEARCH_ARTICLE_THE_EXTRAVERSION_THEME:"5.6.2.1. The Extraversion Theme",
        RESEARCH_ARTICLE_THE_EXTRAVERSION_THEME_CONTENT:"<p>Many personality type models include extraversion-introversion as a personality trait in their model. The Big Five model also includes Extraversion as one of its five main traits.</p><p>Thus, we fully expected this trait to become part of our model as we curated our output descriptions and developed our themes.</p><p>We also expected that the six facets from the Extraversion trait in the Big Five model would have the most important influence on assignment of individuals to the styles in this theme.</p><p>However, as our curation process unfolded, we were surprised by the results. The data tell a different story from common perceptions of extraversion-introversion.</p><p className='research_remove_paragraph_bottom_margin'>The most influential traits for the Extraversion theme are:</p><ol><li>The Friendliness facet from the Extraversion theme</li><li>The Depression facet from the Neuroticism theme</li><li>The Anxiety facet from the Neuroticism theme</li><li>The Self-Consciousness facet from the Neuroticism theme</li><li>The Vulnerability facet from the Neuroticism theme</li><li>The Gregariousness facet from the Extraversion theme</li><li>The Self-Discipline facet from the Conscientiousness theme</li><li>The Cheerfulness facet from the Extraversion theme</li></ol><p>It would be reasonable to assume that all six facets of the Extraversion theme would play important roles in the Extraversion theme, but this turns out not to be the case. Three of the six extraversion facets turn out to be relatively less important than facets related to Neuroticism and Conscientiousness.</p><p>Extraverts and Ambiverts tend to have higher scores for Friendliness than Introverts.</p><p>Extraverts and Ambiverts tend to have lower scores for Depression than Introverts. This is consistent with research that has found a correlation between the amount of social time people have in their lives and depression.</p><p>Extraverts and Ambiverts tend to have lower scores for Vulnerability than Introverts.</p><p>Interestingly, both Extraverts and Introverts tend to score high for Anxiety, while Ambiverts tend to score lower.</p><p>Extraverts and Ambiverts tend to score lower for Self-Consciousness than Introverts.</p><p>The average scores for Gregariousness follow the pattern one would expect: Extraverts are the most gregarious, Ambiverts are in the middle, and Introverts tend to score low.</p><p>Extraverts and Ambiverts score somewhat higher on Self-Discipline than Introverts.</p><p>Extraverts and Ambiverts tend to have similarly high scores for Cheerfulness while Introverts tend to have lower scores.</p><p>Age also plays a role in this theme. There are more young extraverts and introverts, and as people age, there are more Ambiverts.</p><p>The way the different Big Five traits and facets play out in this theme illustrate the benefits of taking a data-driven, machine learning approach to building a personality type model over an approach relying only on human intuition. Human intuition would argue for defining personality styles for Extraverts, Ambiverts and Introverts based only on the Big Five Extraversion trait and its six facets, but it turns out that other traits and facets play equally important roles.</p>",
        RESEARCH_ARTICLE_THE_THINKING_STYLE_THEME:"5.6.2.2. The Thinking Style Theme",
        RESEARCH_ARTICLE_THE_THINKING_STYLE_THEME_CONTENT:"<p>The Thinking style addresses questions like, \"Do you need to have a creative outlet? Do you daydream, playing with abstract ideas, or are you more concrete?\"</p><p className='research_remove_paragraph_bottom_margin'>The most influential traits for the Thinking Style theme are from the \"Openness to Experience\" trait of the Big Five model:</p><ol><li>Intellect</li><li>Imagination</li><li>Artistic Interests</li></ol><p>There's no surprise here, as the theme very closely mirrors those traits.</p><p>It is interesting to note that only three of the five facets from \"Openness to Experience\" play have a primary influence on this style. The Excitement Seeking facet of the Extraversion theme has a more important influence on this style than the other three facets of \"Openness to Experience.\"</p>",

Do you hate when people push you?\"</p><p>The facets that influence this theme are surprising, both on the number of facets that play an important role and the Big Five traits that they come from.</p><p>The most influential facet is Friendliness from the Big Five Extraversion trait. </p><p className='research_remove_paragraph_bottom_margin'>The next four most influential facets are all from the Neuroticism trait:</p><ol><li>Depression</li><li>Anxiety</li><li>Self-Consciousness</li><li>Vulnerability</li></ol><p className='research_remove_paragraph_bottom_margin'>The last two important facets are:</p><ol><li>Gregariousness from the Extraversion trait</li><li>Self-Discipline from the Conscientiousness trait</li></ol><p>This suggests a very rich and complex interplay between the 30 facets and how people relate to learning - on their own and with feedback from others.</p><p>In our analysis, we found two styles that enjoy learning:</p><ol className=\"research_article_ol\"><li>\"These people have a thirst to learn. If they're not learning something new, they may feel like their 'brain is dying'. They like being in environments that challenge them to get better and better every day.<br/><br/>So whether it's a stack of books, picking up a new skill like cooking, or practicing an existing hobby to get better at it, these people will be happiest when they are learning something new on a regular basis.\"</li><li>\"These people have high standards and are constantly learning, pushing themselves to be at the cutting edge of anything they do. People are an especially important part of this process for them. Much of their drive is directed towards learning to improve their relationships. For them, people are a source of mutual support and growth.\"</li></ol><p className='research_remove_paragraph_bottom_margin'>And a third style that prefers to avoid being given feedback:</p><ol start='3'><li>\"These people don't like it when others point out their flaws and push them to change. While they may have plenty of things they would like to improve in their life, they aren't as focused on self development and learning as some.\"</li></ol><p>People in the first two styles generally have higher facet scores for Friendliness, Gregariousness and Cheerfulness.</p><p>People in the third style generally have higher facet scores for Depression, Anxiety and Vulnerability.</p><p>This suggests that people who are friendly and confident generally welcome feedback and learning more than people who prefer to keep to themselves and are more neurotic.</p>",
        RESEARCH_ARTICLE_NUMBER_OF_PERSONALITY:"6. Number of Personality Types",
        RESEARCH_ARTICLE_NUMBER_OF_PERSONALITY_CONTENT:"<p>In our model, we define an individual's \"personality type\" as the composite of their style assignment within each of the 14 themes.</p><p>Thus the total number of personality types in our model is the product of the number of styles in each theme.</p><p>This number is 3 x 8 x 4 x 3 x 6 x 5 x 2 x 3 x 2 x 2 x 3 x 2 x 3 x 8 = 29,859,840 personality types, or about 30 million</p><p>Thus, we have achieved our goal of having a model that is both meaningful and comprehensible to humans, while still covering the breadth of diversity of human personality types.</p><p>By having 14 themes with only two to eight styles within each theme, the model is easy enough for people to understand.</p><p>By having about 30 million personality types, the model gives enough differentiation between people to meaningfully describe the vast diversity of human personality types.",

        RESEARCH_ARTICLE_CROSS_VALIDATION_CONTENT:"<p>We currently generate personality reports in English and Spanish and the test and reports are available online throughout the world in those languages.</p><p>As we conducted our research in Spanish and mostly in Latin America, this raises the question of whether the research can be used to draw conclusions for native English speakers from cultures outside of Latin America.</p><p>The Big Five personality test has been shown to be robust across a wide range of cultures and languages.</p><p>Validity of the test across languages and culture is one issue. There is a separate question of whether the relationship between input variables (test questions responses) and output descriptions (which we used to develop our descriptions of personality types) is stable across languages and cultures.</p><p>The data analytics, research and writing of our styles was conducted by a multinational team from the USA, UK and Colombia working in English and Spanish.</p><p>We believe that the conclusions of our research will be robust across language and cultures. Small sample tests of sharing profile results with native English speakers from the USA, UK and Europe are consistent with this belief. However, we do not yet have statistically significant sample sizes in English and across non Latin American cultures to validate this claim.</p><p>In the near future, we expect to get statistically-meaningful samples from native English speakers around the world, from a variety of cultures. Later we anticipate offering the test and results in additional languages.</p><p>As we gather these new data, we will continue to test and reevaluate the results on a language-by-language, region-by-region and country-by-country basis to evaluate whether the results are consistent across demographic groups or whether the model requires adjustment for different demographic groups.</p><p>If the data do indicate that any adjustments are required, we will update our model accordingly.</p>",

        RESEARCH_ARTICLE_RESEARCH_COMMUNITY_CONTENT:"<p>Our live public site is set up to support the gathering of new research data using a similar process as the one we used on our research site to gather the original data.</p><p>After users have completed the 120 Big Five test questions, we have built in the option to invite them to respond to a small number of additional output descriptions, which they can rate on a Likert scale of -3 to +3.</p><p>When we have no active research in progress, users will not be shown any additional optional questions. When we do have active research in process, the system will select additional questions to display selected randomly from the pool of currently-active output descriptions we are gathering data on.</p><p>Thus, we have a system where we can conduct new research into the relationships between the 30 facets plus age and gender and any output descriptions. We can gather a statistically-valid sample for several hundred output descriptions in a matter of a few days. So, we can achieve fast turn-around on gathering statistically valid samples when we add new output descriptions to test.</p><p>We plan to use this platform for our own ongoing research, and invite other respectable researchers to collaborate with us.</p><p>We are open to collaborating both with academic researchers who can define their research projects and analyze the data themselves, and with non-academics who have a research interest but would not know how to design the project and conduct the analytics themselves. In the latter case, we would work with the non-academic researcher to define the project, conduct the research, evaluate statistical validity and co-publish the results.</p><p>We can test output descriptions provided 'as is' by the other researchers or assist them in developing output descriptions to test based on our experience to date.</p><p>For analysis, we can support researchers by applying our existing machine learning algorithms to the data, or export data for researchers to analyze themselves.</p><p>Of course, in the case of data export, we fully anonymize all data according to the terms set out in our privacy policy.

        GUIDES_ROMANTIC_REPORT_INTRO_DESC:"<p>Elegir a tu pareja es discutiblemente la decisión más importante que tomas en tu vida.</p><p>¿Podría ser esta persona la indicada? En esta guía, lo descubrirás.</p><p>Se le presta mucha atención a salvar una relación, pero se le presta muy poca atención al elegir en primer lugar a la persona indicada. Has tomado una decisión sumamente inteligente al considerar la compatibilidad desde el principio.</p><p>En esta página, descubrirás si son compatibles. Descubrirás en minutos lo que te hubiera llevado meses de citas o años para averiguar.</p><p>Pero antes de hablar de esto, queremos destacar algunos errores que las personas tienden a cometer, una y otra vez. Si deseas evitar estos errores, tómate un minuto para leer esta página antes de sumergirte en la guía.</p><br/><h3>Elige tus problemas</h3><p>Cuando eliges una pareja, estás eligiendo una serie de problemas con los cuales lidiarás por el resto de tu vida.</p><p>Todo el mundo tendrá defectos.</p><p>Tus discusiones y conflictos con una persona serán diferentes a los que tienes con otra. Pero incluso en matrimonios felices y estables, las parejas discuten por las mismas cosas durante décadas. Esto es inevitable.</p><p>La pregunta es, ¿con qué \"defectos\" puedes adaptarte bien?</p><br/><h3>No esperes que cambie</h3><p>Es tentador tratar de ignorar los defectos de alguien durante la etapa de citas, con la esperanza de poder corregir esos defectos cuando entables una relación seria con esta persona.</p><p>Pensar que esto está bien ahora, porque se puede cambiar más tarde.</p><p>Adelanto: el 99% de las veces, esto no cambia.</p><p><blockquote><b>\"El amor es la experiencia de aceptar completamente a alguien tal y como es ahora\".</b></blockquote></p><p>Si amas a alguien con la expectativa de que cambie, no amas a esta persona. Punto final.</p><p>Es importante aceptar a tu pareja tal y como es, sin tener ninguna expectativa de que algunos de sus defectos alguna vez desaparecerán. Y amarla de todos modos.</p><p>Esto no significa que no puedan ayudarse mutuamente a crecer. Pero entablar una relación con la premisa de que las cosas \"malas\" se pueden arreglar luego es una insensatez.</p><br/><h3>Enamórate de esta persona, no de la idea que tienes sobre ella</h3><p>Si tienes una idea fija sobre el tipo específico de relación que quieres lograr - como estar comprometido/a con tu pareja o casarte y tener hijos - tú puedes presionar para crear este tipo de relación con esta persona antes de conocerla lo suficientemente bien como para estar seguro de que esta persona es buen partido para ti.</p><p>Podrías enamorarte de la idea de quien quieres que sea esta persona, no de quien es en realidad.</p><p>Con el tiempo, la burbuja explotará. Esta persona no es quien pensabas que era, todo porque la idealizaste, y luego la pusiste dentro de la relación de fantasía que tenías en tu cabeza.</p><p>Esto lleva a una amarga desilusión y lleva a terminar con un corazón roto. Pero muchas personas vuelven a repetir esto con otra persona - esta <i>nueva</i> persona es la ideal, es la que se ajusta de nuevo a mi fantasía.</p><p>No dejes que este seas tú. Esto es un engaño en el que caen incluso las personas más inteligentes. Al leer esta guía, estarás un paso adelante para conectarte a la realidad de quien la otra persona realmente es, y saber realmente si los dos son compatibles.</p><br/><h3>La regla de los dos años</h3><p>Las investigaciones muestran que las personas que se casan después de haber estado juntas  durante menos de 2 años tienen tasas de divorcio <b>mucho</b> más altas que las personas que han estado con su pareja durante más de dos años antes de casarse.</p><p>Es importante dejar que el período de la luna de miel desaparezca, y haber descubierto cómo manejar sus problemas y diferencias recurrentes <i>antes</i> de casarse.</p><p>Porque casarse no resolverá sus problemas.</p><br/><h3>Casarse no va a resolver sus problemas</h3><p>Muchas parejas tienen problemas los cuales deben afrontar y de todos modos se casan con la esperanza de que \"cuando estemos casados, lo resolveremos todo\".</p><p>Desafortunadamente, esto no funciona así.</p><p>El matrimonio no hace que los problemas desaparezcan mágicamente.</p><p>De hecho, muchas veces es más difícil solucionar los problemas después del matrimonio porque hay muchas cosas más en juego, y por lo tanto, ambas personas se vuelven más tercas con su punto de vista a raíz de sus emociones.</p>",

Es importante que leas esta página antes de leer el resto de la guía.</p><span><h3>🔑 Dos cosas claves</h3></span><p className='research_remove_paragraph_bottom_margin'>Hay dos cosas claves en las cuales concentrarte para mejorar la calidad de tu relación:</p><ol className=\"content_ol\"><li>Aprender a manejar los conflictos juntos</li><li>Entenderse y aceptarse mutuamente</li></ol><p>Vamos a abarcar el conflicto a profundidad en la siguiente sección.</p><p>Después de la sección de conflicto, el resto de la guía se enfoca en entenderse y aceptarse el uno al otro. Explicaremos las dinámicas creadas a partir de sus diferencias de personalidad y les brindamos asesoría sobre cómo manejar cada dinámica.</p><p>En esta página vamos a explicarte algunos conceptos vitales. Estos sirven para cambiar la mentalidad. Ver la guía a través de estos ojos te ayudará a realizar las más grandes mejoras posibles en tu relación.</p><h3>Ninguno de ustedes tiene la \"razón\"</h3><p>A lo largo de la guía, encontrarás lugares en los que tú y tu pareja tienen diferentes personalidades.</p><p>Por ejemplo, muchas parejas tienen una persona ordenada y la otra desordenada.</p><p>Ninguno de los dos tiene la \"razón\".</p><p>Tú ves el mundo de cierta manera, y probablemente pienses que todos los demás lo ven de la misma manera… pero no es así. Tu pareja lo ve de otra forma y la manera en como ve las cosas tiene tanto <i>sentido para tu pareja</i> así como tu forma de ver las cosas tiene sentido para ti.</p><blockquote><i>\"Vemos a las personas y las cosas no tal y como son, sino como nosotros somos. Por eso, cuando dos personas miran algo o a alguien, se obtienen dos reacciones diferentes\".</i><br/> - Anthony De Mello, <i>Conciencia</i></blockquote><p>Es fácil ver que el punto de vista de la otra persona es erróneo, ya que no es igual al tuyo. Es fácil pensar en lo que tu pareja \"debería\" hacer y cómo \"debería\" pensar, así igual que tú. Qué coincidencia, ¿eh?</p><p>Pero ambos estilos de personalidad son igualmente válidos. Uno no es mejor que el otro.</p><h3>No esperes que tu pareja cambie</h3><p>Muchas personas tienen la fantasía de que si tan solo su pareja cambiara X ó Y cosa, de repente todo sería fantástico.</p><p>Desafortunadamente, esto no funciona así.</p><p>Querer que tu pareja cambie es un camino al abismo. Esto no funciona. Porque el 99% de las veces, esta persona no cambia. Y tratar de hacerla cambiar en realidad sólo empeora las cosas.</p><blockquote><i>\"El amor es la experiencia de aceptar completamente a alguien tal y como es ahora\".</i></blockquote><p>Si amas a alguien con la expectativa de que cambie, no amas a esta persona. Punto final.</p><p>Es importante aceptar a tu pareja tal y como es, sin tener ninguna expectativa de que algunos de sus defectos alguna vez desaparecerán. Y amarla de todas formas.</p><p>Tú y tu pareja no van a cambiar, pero pueden cambiar las <i>dinámicas</i> de como interactúan. Y esto puede cambiarlo todo.</p><h3>La mayoría de tus problemas nunca desaparecerán</h3><p>Las investigaciones sugieren que el 76% de las discusiones de parejas son sobre problemas recurrentes que provienen de diferencias fundamentales de la personalidad.</p><p>Estas son realmente buenas noticias. Tan pronto entiendas cuales son sus diferencias principales, aceptes la forma de ser de la otra persona, la cual es igual de válida a la tuya y hagas pequeños ajustes, en consecuencia, estas discusiones recurrentes pasarán con menos frecuencia - o jamás volverán a pasar.</p><h3>La aceptación es fundamental</h3><p>Entonces, tu pareja es diferente a ti. Su punto de vista y personalidad es tan válido como el tuyo. Todo lo que esta persona hace tiene tanto sentido para ella como todo lo que tú haces tiene sentido para ti. Y tu pareja no va a cambiar.</p><p>Tu único camino a seguir es la aceptación.</p><p><b>Tu relación nunca mejorará hasta que aceptes a tu pareja tal y como es, sin expectativas de que esta cambie.</b> Lo mismo va para tu pareja aceptándote a ti tal y como eres.</p><p>Es fácil \"aceptar\" a tu pareja mientras que todavía te aferras en secreto a tus ideas de lo que tu pareja \"debería\" hacer.</p><p>El \"debería\" es el camino al abismo. Cuanto más elimines los \"debería\" de tus pensamientos, más mejorará tu vida y tu relación.</p><p className='research_remove_paragraph_bottom_margin'>Cuando leas la guía, enfócate en:</p><ol className=\"content_ol\"><li>Ponerte en los zapatos de tu pareja para así entender su punto de vista y su forma de ser</li><li>Aceptar que la manera de ser de tu pareja es tan \"correcta\" como la tuya</li><li>Aceptar que esto nunca cambiará</li></ol><p>Esta aceptación es la base de todo amor. Y es el mejor camino a seguir.</p><h3>\"Debería\" es una palabrota</h3><p>Todas las personas tenemos valores. Todos tenemos creencias sobre que es lo que hace que una persona sea buena.</p><p>Un ejemplo de una de estas creencias sería: \"Si una persona en la familia está teniendo dificultades económicas y otra persona de la familia está ganando mucho dinero, entonces la persona que gana mucho dinero debería ayudar a la persona que tiene dificultades. Esto es lo que hacen las personas buenas\".</p><p>¿Puedes encontrar el problema aquí?</p><p>El problema <i>no</i> es el punto de vista. Es un punto de vista perfectamente válido que tienen muchas personas.</p><p><b>El problema es que \"esto es lo que hacen las personas buenas\". Esto es así porque se supone que un punto de vista es una verdad universal. Significa que \"todos están de acuerdo\" en que esto es lo que hacen las personas buenas. Significa que este punto de vista es objetivamente correcto y otros puntos de vista son objetivamente incorrectos.</b></p><p>Por ello, si tienes dinero y <i>no</i> ayudas a tu familia, eres una mala persona. Y mi trabajo es mostrarte el error de tu forma de pensar para que te des cuenta de que tú estás equivocado y que yo tengo la razón. ¿Está bien?</p><p>Bueno, no.</p><p>El problema es que esto no es un valor universal. Algunas personas creen que, a menos que el miembro de la familia en cuestión esté en una situación <i>realmente</i> difícil, ayudarlos a aprender por sí mismos es en realidad un acto más amoroso.</p><p>La pregunta aquí no es \"¿Cuál de los dos tiene la razón?\" Ninguno tiene la razón, ninguno está equivocada. Ambos puntos de vista son válidos. Ambos puntos de vista tienen sentido para la persona que lo cree así.</p><p className='research_remove_paragraph_bottom_margin'>Más bien, el punto es:</p><ul className='content_ol'><li>Reconocer que no todo el mundo comparte tu visión del mundo. Es reconocer que no todas las personas están de acuerdo en lo que \"debería\" hacer una buena persona.</li><li>Reconocer que es posible que tu pareja ni siquiera sepa cual es tu visión del mundo.</li><li>Reconocer que si tu pareja no actúa como tú crees que \"debería\" actuar, esto no significa que sea una mala persona.</li><li>Reconocer que el punto de vista de tu pareja es tan válido como el tuyo (¡loco, ¿verdad?!).</li></ul><p className='research_remove_paragraph_bottom_margin'>Imaginemos un conflicto basado en este ejemplo. </p><ul className='content_ol'><li className='li_style_bullet'>\"Me duele mucho que tengas todo ese dinero, y que no me ayudes. Estoy aquí con dificultades y siento que a ti no te importa. Los familiares se ayudan mutuamente, eso es lo que hacen todas las personas\".</li></ul><p className='research_remove_paragraph_bottom_margin'>Este es el patrón que queremos romper. En cambio, di:</p><ul className='content_ol'><li className='li_style_bullet'>\"Me duele que tengas todo ese dinero, y que no me ayudes. Estoy aquí con dificultades y siento que a ti no te importa.</li><li className='li_style_bullet'>Una de mis creencias fundamentales es que la familia se ayuda mutuamente en situaciones como estas. Esto es lo que creo que hacen las personas buenas. Pero ... por más loco que me parezca, me doy cuenta de que no compartes este valor, y me gustaría entender como piensas al respecto \".</li></ul><p>Este es el cambio que deseas hacer: hablar de ello como tu valor central y luego pedirle a la otra persona que te ayude a comprender <i>su</i> valor.</p><p>Esto va más allá de este ejemplo. Nuestras vidas están llenas de creencias sobre lo que las personas \"deberían\" hacer. </p><p>Pero estos \"deberían\" que tenemos no se basan en la realidad objetiva. Se basan en nuestros propios valores y personalidades, en la familia y la cultura en la que crecimos, en nuestra educación y nuestras experiencias en la vida.</p><p>Creemos que nuestra pareja debería compartir estos valores, y esta creencia se convierte en una expectativa sobre como debería actuar nuestra pareja. Y luego nos enojamos cuando no actúa de esta manera. Y luego intentamos cambiarla.</p><p>Hacer este cambio de perspectiva requerirá algo de práctica.</p><p>Por ahora, recuerda que los valores que son tan obvios para ti no son en realidad universales. Que tu pareja puede tener valores diferentes y seguir siendo una buena persona. Y pregúntale cuáles son sus valores, antes de enojarte con tu pareja por no actuar de acuerdo a tus valores.</p><blockquote><i>\"Los sueños nunca son los mismos para dos personas. En una relación, podemos fingir ser iguales, pensar igual, sentir igual, soñar igual, pero no hay forma de que esto suceda. Hay dos soñadores con dos sueños. Cada soñador va a soñar a su manera. Por eso debemos aceptar las diferencias que existen entre dos soñadores; tenemos que respetar el sueño del otro mutuamente.\"</i></br>- Don Miguel Ruiz, Maestría en el amor</blockquote><h3>Hacer esto toma tiempo</h3><p>Si bien la mayoría de parejas experimentan grandes mejoras casi de inmediato, otras cosas toman más tiempo.</p><p>Si encuentran que tienen problemas con los cuales están atascados, nuestro coaching es una buena manera para ayudarlos a deshacerse de estos problemas.</p><h3>Habla sobre esto</h3><p>Al final de la guía, tenemos una sección llamada \"Qué sigue\".</p><p>En esta, explicaremos como tener conversaciones productivas con tu pareja sobre la guía, de modo que tenga el impacto más rápido en la calidad de tu relación y de forma que ayude a cualquiera de las partes evitar ponerse a la defensiva en la relación.</p><h3>Breve y al grano</h3><p>A propósito hacemos que la guía sea lo más breve posible.</p><p>El consejo es breve y conciso, pero no te dejes engañar por lo largo que sea. En cada párrafo hay mucha información que puede tener un gran impacto en la mejora de la calidad de tu relación, cuando te detienes a pensar en todo minuciosamente.</p><p>Leerlo es sólo el primer paso.

        GUIDES_ROMANTIC_REPORT_CONFLICT_DESC: "<p>Las investigaciones sugieren que la forma en la cual una pareja maneja los conflictos es <i>lo más</i> importante para determinar las posibilidades de éxito. Esto es así porque todas las parejas tienen conflictos, incluso aquellas que han estado felizmente casadas durante décadas. Muchas veces, las parejas felices discuten sobre las mismas cosas una y otra vez durante años, algo que los investigadores llaman \"problemas perpetuos\".</p><p>Ya que todas las relaciones implican tener conflictos, la manera en la cual se manejan estos conflictos es de vital importancia. Dos parejas con el mismo problema tendrán resultados muy diferentes según lo bien que manejen el conflicto.</p><p>Los terapeutas y la sociedad generalmente afirman que hay una forma \"correcta\" de manejar los conflictos. Afortunadamente y desafortunadamente, en el contexto de las relaciones, esto simplemente no es cierto. Lo que los terapeutas recomiendan que hagas podría funcionar con una pareja y empeorar todo con otra.</p><p>Lo que realmente es importante es la <i>combinación</i> particular de los estilos de conflicto en la relación. ¿Cuáles son las dinámicas creadas cuando pones tu estilo de conflicto en una relación con el estilo de conflicto de tu pareja?</p><p>En muchos casos, la mejor manera de manejar los conflictos va en contra de los consejos tradicionales.</p><p>En nuestra Guía para parejas, damos consejos a las parejas en función de sus estilos de conflicto. Explicamos como manejar mejor los conflictos, de acuerdo a sus personalidades.</p><p>Eso no es lo que encontrarás aquí en la Guía de compatibilidad romántica. En esta guía, la idea es brindarte una <i>previsualización</i> de como serían normalmente las dinámicas - una idea de lo que se puede esperar.</p><p>¿Será difícil o problemático? ¿Son ustedes dos muy diferentes? ¿Qué tendrás que aceptar sobre el estilo de conflicto de tu pareja? ¿Estás preparado para aceptarlo? ¿Podrías ser manejable el conflicto con esta persona teniendo la orientación adecuada o siempre será muy difícil?</p><p>Si bien el cambio es ciertamente posible, es poco probable. Al iniciar una relación, es importante aceptar a tu pareja tal cual es, asumiendo que esta nunca cambiará. Al leer esta página, pregúntate - ¿esto suena como algo con lo que yo podría sentirme cómodo/a a largo plazo?</p>",

Si necesitan elegir ejemplos específicos, elijan el ejemplo <i> menos </i>emocional posible. Ahora no es el momento de mencionar los problemas más difíciles que enfrentan juntos.</li><li>Eviten culparse. <b> No importa de quién fue la culpa.</b> Los dos están buscando mejorar las cosas en el futuro, no sentirse bien porque los problemas del pasado \"no fueron mi culpa\".

        GUIDES_COUPLE_REPORT_CONFLICT:"<p>Como mencionamos en la Introducción, hay dos cosas clave para enfocarse con el fin de mejorar la calidad de tu relación:</p><p><ol className='content_ol'><li>Aprender a manejar los conflictos juntos</li><li>Entenderse y aceptarse mutuamente</li></ol></p><p>En esta página, nos enfocamos en el primer punto: manejar bien los conflictos. Esta es la sección más larga de la guía.</p><p>La forma en la cual manejas el conflicto en tu relación determina su trayectoria. ¿Vas a mejorar y mejorar, o empeorar cada vez más?</p><p>Las investigaciones sugieren que la manera en la que una pareja maneja los conflictos juntos es el factor más importante para determinar qué tan felices son (y que tan probable es que termine la relación).</p><p>Mejorar la manera en la que manejan los conflictos juntos es lo más parecido a tener un remedio milagroso en las relaciones.</p><p>Pero, como mencionamos antes, los consejos tradicionales no son muy buenos - en parte porque son iguales para todos.</p><p>Sus estilos de conflicto individuales son importantes, pero lo que realmente importa es la dinámica creada en una relación cuando juntan cada uno de sus estilos. Lo que hemos escrito es específico para ustedes dos.</p><p>El consejo que damos en esta página puede ser contrario a lo que has escuchado antes. Pero confía en nosotros. Pruébalo. Está respaldado por una combinación de investigaciones y décadas de experiencia trabajando con cientos de miles de personas.</p><p>Si encuentras que no estás de acuerdo con algo aquí, piénsalo durante unos días. Muchas veces, no estarás de acuerdo con algunas cosas, pero luego te darás cuenta y dirás \"Eh, eso realmente <i>era</i> cierto\".</p><p>El consejo que tenemos aquí está escrito para parejas con sus dos estilos de conflicto. Aunque es muy específico, incluso las parejas con el mismo estilo de conflicto pueden tener más problemas con algunas cosas que con otras. Si les damos consejos sobre como manejar algo que no es un problema grande para ustedes, esta es una buena noticia, pueden leerlo y seguir adelante.</p><blockquote><i>\"Las conversaciones difíciles casi nunca tratan sobre aclarar los verdaderos hechos. Estos son sobre percepciones, interpretaciones y valores contradictorios.\"</i><br/>- Douglas Stone, Universidad de Harvard</blockquote><p>Hay dos grupos grandes de conflictos: </p><p><ol className='content_ol'><li>Cosas que se pueden solucionar. Siguiendo los consejos en esta página y en la sección ¿Qué sigue?, podrás resolver muchos de tus conflictos recurrentes y manejar mucho mejor la mayoría de tus conflictos.</li><li>Cosas que no se pueden solucionar. Algunos conflictos se deben a diferencias de personalidad entre ustedes que probablemente nunca desaparecerán. Estas diferencias simplemente no tienen solución.<br/><br/>Pero está bien - lo mismo ocurre con las parejas que han estado felizmente casadas durante 50 años. Cada pareja tiene estos problemas recurrentes que no se resuelven, y tratar desesperadamente de resolverlos puede hacer más mal que bien.<br/><br/>Manejar mejor estos conflictos no significa necesariamente encontrar una solución, lo cual puede ser imposible. Más bien, significa hacer que el problema sea menos doloroso, hacer que cause menos molestias y que sea menos problemático. <i>Esto</i> se puede lograr, incluso si el problema realmente nunca se \"soluciona\".<br/><br/><b>Por lo tanto, mejorar la forma en la cual manejan los conflictos mejorará su relación incluso si los problemas realmente no se resuelven.</b></li></ol></p><p>Y mejorar la manera en la cual manejan los conflictos no sólo elimina lo negativo de su relación. Quizás sorprendentemente, mejorar la manera en la que manejan los conflictos en realidad hace que se abra la relación para que se llenen de mucho más amor, comprensión, aceptación y magia. </p><p>Dicho todo esto, comencemos.</p>",

        OUR_MODEL_SIDE_NAV_2_DESC:"<p>Nosotros no elegimos estos temas. Los encontramos en nuestros datos. Son patrones claros que surgieron en nuestra investigación.</p><p>En el proceso de elaboración del modelo, descubrimos algunas cosas que van en contra del pensamiento popular sobre la personalidad. Por ejemplo, se suele decir que los introvertidos son soñadores creativos. Pero descubrimos que estos temas son independientes entre sí - son temas diferentes. Ser introvertido no significa que una persona sea soñadora o más creativa. De igual forma, estar motivado por los resultados y orientado a los objetivos no significa que no se anhele profundamente la conexión emocional.</p><p>De este modo, cada uno de estos temas son independientes entre sí.</p><p>A continuación te mostramos un resumen de cada uno de los temas, y cada uno de los estilos en cada tema. <b>Estos resúmenes están simplificados</b> - en realidad, hay una cantidad increíble de matices en cada estilo en los cuales no profundizaremos aquí, ya que sería demasiado largo.</p><span><h3>☀️ Altruismo</h3></span><p>¿Te sientes impulsado emocionalmente por ayudar a los demás? ¿O sólo te preocupas genuinamente por tu propio círculo íntimo de personas? ¿Hay algo que se interponga para ayudar a los demás?</p><p><b>Estilo 1</b></p><p>Estas personas son altruistas. Se sienten impulsadas a nivel emocional para ayudar a los demás - a todos, no sólo a los más cercanos. No es una carga para estas personas, sino una fuente de satisfacción.</p><p><b>Estilo 2</b></p><p>Estas personas solo se preocupan <i>genuinamente</i> por las personas cercanas a ellas. Cuando ayudan a personas que están fuera de su círculo íntimo, esto viene de un lugar racional por querer marcar la máxima diferencia posible, mas no porque sientan lástima o esto llegue a lo más profundo de sus corazones.</p><p><b>Estilo 3</b></p><p>Los problemas de estas personas los agota emocionalmente. Se preocupan mucho por los demás, pero si están lidiando con sus propios problemas, estos terminan consumiendo su energía. Debido a esto, algunas personas pueden malinterpretarlos y pensar que estas personas son egoístas.</p><span><h3>😑 Conflicto</h3></span><p>¿Cómo manejas los conflictos? ¿Huyes del conflicto, luchas por lograr la tranquilidad o no te importa tener una pelea? Cuando estás entre la espada y la pared, ¿estás dispuesto a mentir o manipular?</p><p>Este es uno de los temas más importantes, especialmente para las relaciones interpersonales.</p><p><b>Estilo 1</b></p><p>Estas personas tienen una alta inteligencia emocional. En un conflicto, usan sus habilidades sociales para lograr tranquilidad en las situaciones, llegar al fondo del problema y encontrar una solución en la que todos ganen. </p><p><b>Estilo 2</b></p><p>Estas personas son como el estilo 1, pero en lugar de estar motivadas principalmente por mantener la tranquilidad, están impulsadas por el <i>desempeño</i>. Constantemente se esfuerzan para llegar a otro nivel.</p><p><b>Estilo 3</b></p><p>Estas personas también son como el estilo 1, pero realmente no les gusta el conflicto y tratan de evitarlo. Cuando tienen algo de lo que quieren hablar con alguien, se crea un dilema interno: no quieren causar conflicto al sacar el tema a relucir, pero si no lo hacen, el problema simplemente se agrava.</p><p><b>Estilo 4</b></p><p>Estas personas evitan el conflicto. Prefieren permanecer en su zona de confort, lidiando con conversaciones incómodas sólo cuando es realmente necesario. Cuando surgen conflictos, se sienten cómodos dejando que otros tomen la iniciativa.</p><p><b>Estilo 5</b></p><p>Al igual que los estilos 3 y 4, estas personas prefieren evitar el conflicto. No son tan buenas al resolver el conflicto y recuperar la tranquilidad como las personas del estilo 1, pero definitivamente pueden hacer este trabajo.</p><p><b>Estilo 6</b></p><p>En contraste con los primeros cinco estilos, estas personas no huyen del conflicto. En el conflicto, respetan a los demás y cooperan. Sin embargo, valoran la <i>honestidad</i> por encima de la <i>tranquilidad.</i> Si algo les molesta, lo dicen. Si no comparten lo que sienten se sentirían deshonestos consigo mismos. A veces, pueden molestar a la otra persona por ser \"demasiado honestos\".</p><p>Si las cosas no parecen ir a ninguna parte, es posible que le digan a la otra persona lo que esta quiere escuchar para que deje de molestarlos.</p><p><b>Estilo 7</b></p><p>Este grupo generalmente es bueno al manejar el conflicto, pero cuando las emociones van rápido, pueden explotar - como lo hacen muchas personas cuando se sienten presionadas. Pueden decir y hacer algunas cosas de las que luego se arrepientan, porque no saben que más hacer.</p><p><b>Estilo 8</b></p><p>Estas personas confían en que conocen la mejor manera de hacer las cosas y, en general, quieren que las cosas se hagan a su manera. Cuando las personas no están de acuerdo con ellos, es probable que no tengan problemas para tomar el control y hacer lo que creen necesario para asegurarse de que las cosas se hagan bien. Hacen mucho por las personas más cercanas a ellos y esperan lealtad a cambio.</p><span><h3>🥰 Emociones</h3></span><p>¿Anhelas una conexión emocional profunda con los demás? ¿Son las emociones una estrella guía en tu vida, o este enunciado ni siquiera tiene sentido para ti?</p><p><b>Estilo 1</b></p><p>Las emociones son importantes para estas personas. Son una influencia para orientar sus vidas. Sin embargo, están más protegidos emocionalmente que otras personas. Es posible que no se sientan completamente cómodos expresando lo que sienten. Esta puede ser la razón por la cual ven las cosas más en términos de acciones y resultados, que de sentimientos.</p><p><b>Estilo 2</b></p><p>Estas personas no son muy expresivas emocionalmente. Incluso podrían confundirse por que otras personas le dan tanta importancia a las emociones. Sin embargo crean lazos fuertes con personas, pero estos no se basan en una conexión emocional profunda.</p><p><b>Estilo 3</b></p><p>En contraste con el estilo 2, estas personas se conectan con otras personas principalmente a través de los sentimientos. La conexión emocional profunda es importante para ellos en todas las áreas de sus vidas especialmente en las relaciones románticas. La idea de que muchas otras personas no se conectan principalmente a través de los sentimientos puede incluso resultarles inconcebible.</p><p><b>Estilo 4</b></p><p>Estas personas se sienten cómodas con las emociones, pero no están regidas por estas. No tienen miedo de mostrar sus propias emociones y, aunque están conscientes de las emociones de otros, estas realmente no les abruman. En pocas palabras, son emocionalmente estables.</p><span><h3>💬 Extroversión</h3></span><p>¿Te encanta estar rodeado de otras personas? ¿Necesitas interacción social para ser feliz? ¿Te sientes cómodo en situaciones sociales? ¿Necesitas tener \"tiempo a solas\"?</p><p><b>Extrovertidos</b></p><p>Estas personas son extrovertidas. Les encanta socializar y se sienten con energía después de pasar tiempo con amigos. Contrariamente a la creencia popular, los extrovertidos no siempre son fiesteros. Sin duda, para estas personas, los grandes eventos sociales son divertidos. Les gustan las personas. Pero lo que realmente es importante para ellos es disfrutar del tiempo con sus amigos.</p><p><b>Ambivertidos</b></p><p>Estas personas son ambivertidas. Les gusta ser sociables y se sienten cómodas con otras personas. Cuando socializan, prefieren grupos más pequeños donde puedan hablar con todos. Pero a diferencia de los extrovertidos, no necesitan tanto tiempo social y son igualmente felices cuando están solos.</p><p><b>Introvertidos</b></p><p>Estas personas son introvertidas. Disfrutan pasar tiempo a solas y frecuentemente les gusta que los dejen solos. Sin embargo, tienen un pequeño número de amigos cercanos. Prefieren socializar en grupos pequeños donde conocen a todas las personas, o uno a uno. Los grupos grandes pueden ser demasiado para ellos. Cuando conocen a alguien nuevo, les toma tiempo sentirse completamente cómodos y abiertos.</p><span><h3>🏔 Motivaciones</h3></span><p>¿Qué te motiva en la vida? ¿Cuáles son tus prioridades - es la familia, una carrera profesional o el prestigio?</p><p><b>Estilo 1</b></p><p>Estas personas son eficientes y siempre buscan mejorar la forma de hacer sus cosas. La carrera profesional es importante para ellos. Dicho esto, la amistad y la felicidad son más importantes para ellos que los resultados. Curiosamente, para estas personas, la amistad trata sobre lograr cosas juntos. La familia también es una de las cosas más importantes para ellos.</p><p><b>Estilo 2</b></p><p>Estas personas son similares a las del estilo 1, pero no creen que la amistad trata sobre lograr cosas juntos, y la familia es menos importante para ellos. A estas personas también les importa más ser felices y sentirse bien antes que las cosas materiales como el dinero, verse bien ante los demás y el prestigio.</p><p><b>Estilo 3</b></p><p>A estas personas les gusta dirigir a otros. Prefieren tener el control en lugar de que les digan que tienen que hacer. También les gusta destacarse y ser reconocidos por su éxito. Aunque sí les importa su familia, esta no juega un papel importante en su vida como lo es para algunas personas.</p><p><b>Estilo 4</b></p><p>Mientras que otros tienen motivaciones específicas, estas personas son más flexibles. No es que estén desmotivadas. Simplemente hacen lo suyo, paso a paso, sin necesidad de alardear. No buscan prestigio, ascensos o puestos de liderazgo. No les incomoda ser líderes, pero no es una meta para estas personas serlo.</p><p><b>Estilo 5</b></p><p>Estas personas están motivadas por la familia, la comunidad y las relaciones en vez del poder, la fama o el éxito material. Si tienen hijos, ellos son una fuente esencial del significado de sus vidas. Y si no tienen, es probable que canalicen su naturaleza esencial de cuidar en alguna otra cosa - como un jardín, mascotas, o proyectos en comunidad. Las interacciones sociales para estas personas no tienen un objetivo. A diferencia de otros, están completamente presentes, disfrutando cada pequeño momento.</p><p><b>Estilo 6</b></p><p>A estas personas les importa más el dinero y el estatus en comparación con los demás. Sin embargo, estas cosas no son <i>sumamente</i> importantes para ellos. Esto no es un factor que define la personalidad de ellos.</p><span><h3>🛣 Objetivos y energía</h3></span><p>¿Te importan las metas o prefieres dejarte llevar por la corriente? ¿Tiene la energía para perseguir lo que quieres en la vida o necesita un empujón?</p><p><b>Estilo 1</b></p><p>Estas personas están motivadas por sus metas. Saben cuales son estas y trabajan duro para lograrlas. Invierten en su desarrollo personal, asumen su responsabilidad y llevan a cabo sus decisiones. Esto es tan automático para ellos, puede ser sorprendente para ellos descubrir que muchas personas no tienen metas y no están trabajando para lograr nada.</p><p><b>Estilo 2</b></p><p>Estas personas son muy similares a las del estilo 1, pero aún más trabajadoras. Están muy orientadas al futuro y les gusta planificar con anticipación para estar listos ante cualquier cosa. Suelen hacer más de lo que se les pide.</p><p><b>Estilo 3</b></p><p>Como los dos primeros estilos, estas personas están orientadas al futuro. Tienen sueños para sus vidas y su futuro, en los cuales piensan todo el tiempo. Pero parece que no pueden encontrar la energía para hacer el trabajo necesario para lograr su visión. Se sienten estancados y es desalentador para ellos. Ellos podrían apreciar tener el apoyo de alguien que los mantenga en el camino correcto.</p><p><b>Estilo 4</b></p><p>Estas personas están felices generalmente relajándose.</p><p>Lo hacen mejor en ambientes con estructura donde hay una orientación clara sobre que hacer y cuando hacerlo. Esta estructura les da motivación. Saben que hacer y pueden concentrarse en hacerlo. Después de todo es difícil estar motivado cuando no está claro lo que ellos deberían estar haciendo.</p><p><b>Estilo 5</b></p><p>Mientras que algunas personas gastan mucho tiempo pensando en el futuro, estas personas son más relajadas. No luchan con motivación aunque tienen suficiente energía para perseguir las cosas que les importan. Pero no son adictos al trabajo. Hacen las cosas a su ritmo.</p><span><h3>🧽 Orden</h3></span><p>¿Mantienes tu casa limpia y ordenada o está desordenada? ¿Ni siquiera notas el desorden en primer lugar?</p><p><b>Estilo 1</b></p><p>Para estas personas es importante mantener todas las cosas organizadas. Ellos siempre vuelven a poner las cosas donde estaban. Ellos también prefieren hacer las cosas de acuerdo a sus planes.</p><p><b>Estilo 2</b></p><p>A estas personas no les importa si su casa está ordenada o desordenada. No es que sean perezosos, simplemente no es tan importante para ellos. De hecho, generalmente <i>ni siquiera</i> notan el desorden porque no les molesta.</p><span><h3>🧗 Riesgos</h3></span><p>¿Suena como algo divertido practicar paracaidismo? ¿O eres más cauteloso? ¿Cómo manejas tus finanzas?</p><p><b>Estilo 1</b></p><p>A casi todo el mundo le gusta viajar, pero para estas personas, es aún más importante. Aventuras espontáneas y emocionantes les dan energía. No están obsesionados con planear cada pequeño detalle de forma anticipada, estas personas están dispuestas a correr riesgos.</p><p><b>Estilo 2</b></p><p>Estas personas generalmente son prudentes, particularmente en relaciones románticas. Siguen las reglas y hacen las cosas correctas. No les gustan las actividades arriesgadas, extremas, o peligrosas. Esto no los hace personas aburridas, simplemente obtienen satisfacción de otras maneras.</p><p><b>Estilo 3</b></p><p>Estas personas están entre los dos primeros grupos. Probablemente no los encontrarás haciendo paracaidismo, pero tampoco son particularmente cautelosas.</p><span><h3>🎨 Estilo de pensamiento</h3></span><p>¿Necesitas tener una expresión creativa? ¿Sueñas despierto, juegas con ideas abstractas o eres una persona más concreta?</p><p><b>Estilo 1</b></p><p>Estas personas son muy creativas, les encanta perderse en sus pensamientos, crear cosas y tener discusiones intelectuales y filosóficas. Tener una expresión creativa es muy importante para ellos.</p><p><b>Estilo 2</b></p><p>Estas personas son prácticas. Están menos interesadas en ideas abstractas, en cambio se centran en cosas concretas.</p><span><h3>🛫 Variedad</h3></span><p>¿Necesitas tener muchas experiencias nuevas o te sientes cómodo haciendo las mismas cosas una y otra vez?</p><p><b>Estilo 1</b></p><p>La mayoría de personas piensan en la variedad como una preferencia, algo bueno. Pero resulta que no es así para estas personas. Para ellos la variedad y las nuevas experiencias son una <i>necesidad</i>. Nuevas experiencias les da energía. Si ellos hicieran lo mismo todos los días, llegarían a ser muy infelices. Eso no significa precisamente que necesiten <i>constantemente</i> estas nuevas experiencias. Todos tienen un balance ideal.</p><p><b>Estilo 2</b></p><p>Si bien estas personas no están necesariamente en contra de la variedad o intentar cosas nuevas, esto realmente no es tan importante para ellos. Están perfectamente felices pasando su tiempo con las mismas personas una y otra vez. Les gusta tener rutinas en su vida diaria y esto les funciona bien.</p><span><h3>📋 Reglas</h3></span><p>¿Te rebelas contra la autoridad? ¿Encuentras las reglas restrictivas y aburridas o son algo tranquilizante?</p><p><b>Estilo 1</b></p><p>Para estas personas las reglas son algo cuadriculado, no son sólo limitantes, también son propiamente algo aburrido. Ellos prefieren hacer las cosas a su manera.</p><p><b>Estilo 2</b></p><p>Estas personas respetan la autoridad y siguen las reglas. Ya sea en el trabajo o en su vida personal, prefieren que otros también sigan las reglas.</p><p><b>Estilo 3</b></p><p>Mientras que a algunas personas les gustan las reglas y el orden, y otras personas son más rebeldes, a estas personas realmente no les importa ser parte de ninguno de estos extremos. Estas personas son flexibles y se llevan bien con ambos tipos de personas.</p><span><h3>🔬 Perfeccionismo</h3></span><p>¿Eres perfeccionista?</p><p><b>Estilo 1</b></p><p>Es extremadamente importante para estas personas hacer un excelente trabajo. Hacer las cosas muy bien. Detectan errores y quieren ocuparse de cada detalle. Llevado a un extremo, estas personas son perfeccionistas.</p><p><b>Estilo 2</b></p><p>Los pequeños errores no vuelven locas a estas personas como a otras personas. Les importa el trabajo de calidad, pero no van a seguir esforzándose hasta que todo esté perfecto.</p><span><h3>📚 Aprendizaje</h3></span><p>¿Te encanta aprender? Si no estás aprendiendo algo nuevo, ¿sientes que tu \"cerebro se está muriendo\"? ¿Odias cuando la gente te presiona?</p><p><b>Estilo 1</b></p><p>Estas personas tienen sed de aprender. Si no aprenden algo nuevo, pueden sentir que \"su cerebro está muriendo\". Prefieren trabajar en un ambiente que los desafíe para mejorar y mejorar cada día.</p><p>Así que donde haya un montón de libros, aprender una nueva habilidad como cocinar, o practicar un pasatiempo para mejorar, estas personas serán más felices cuando aprendan algo nuevo de forma habitual.</p><p><b>Estilo 2</b></p><p>Estas personas tienen altas exigencias de sí mismas y están aprendiendo constantemente, esforzándose para estar a la vanguardia de todo lo que hacen. Las personas son una parte especialmente importante de este proceso para ellos. Gran parte de sus impulsos están dirigidos a aprender a mejorar sus relaciones. Para ellos, las personas son una fuente de apoyo y crecimiento mutuo.</p><p><b>Estilo 3</b></p><p>A estas personas no les gustan las personas que siempre señalan sus defectos y tratan de hacerlos cambiar. Aunque estas personas tienen muchas cosas que les gustaría mejorar en sus vidas, no se enfocan en el desarrollo personal y aprender, como algunas otras personas.</p>",
        OUR_MODEL_SIDE_NAV_3:"¿Es una personalidad mejor que otra?",
        OUR_MODEL_SIDE_NAV_3_DESC:"<h3>Diferentes, no mejores</h3><p>Muchas personas leen su perfil y piensan: \"¿Son cosas positivas para todas las personas o sólo son para mí?\"</p><p>Tu perfil de Interpersonality describe como piensas y como ves el mundo. La forma en que ves las cosas parece obvia para ti, y la mayoría de personas asumen que todos los demás ven las cosas de la misma manera. Ya que tu visión del mundo te parece obvia y correcta para ti, cuando tu perfil describa tu visión del mundo de vuelta, esto va a parecer positivo.</p><p>Pero tu personalidad no es positiva ni negativa. Cada estilo individual tiene un conjunto de <i>características</i> que vienen con ambas cosas ya sean buenas y malas, depende de a quien le preguntes y del contexto. Lo que tú ves como algo positivo, alguien más puede verlo como algo negativo. Lo que funciona en una situación puede fracasar en otra.</p><p>Por ejemplo, las personas que están orientadas hacia los objetivos, cuando lean sobre esta parte de si mismos lo verán como algo sumamente positivo. Pero si se casan con alguien que prefiere simplemente relajarse, su pareja lo encontrará molesto y querrá que lo deje de hacer y que sólo <i>estén</i> juntos.</p><p>Tu forma de ver el mundo no es la forma \"correcta\". Otras personas piensan de manera diferente, y su punto de vista tiene tanto sentido para ellos como tu punto de vista tiene sentido para ti. No hay una personalidad \"correcta\".</p><p>Una vez que comprendas esto, será mucho más fácil aceptar a los demás tal y como son. Y aceptar a alguien tal y como es mejora drásticamente tu relación con los demás.</p><h3>Correlaciones con los resultados en la vida</h3><p>Dicho todo esto, algunos estilos <i>sí</i> se correlacionan más fuertemente con resultados positivos en la vida - ser feliz, tener buenas relaciones, etc.</p><p>Un tema adicional que no enumeramos anteriormente son los resultados en la vida. Básicamente, ¿eres feliz? ¿tus relaciones salen bien? ¿tienes ansiedad y miedo?</p><p>Hay 8 estilos en el tema de resultados en la vida. Dado que estos realmente no describen tu personalidad, los dejamos en la descripción arriba.</p><p>Pero la correlación no es causalidad. Aunque algunas personalidades tienen más probabilidades que otras de ser felices y tener buenas relaciones, esto no significa que las otras personalidades no sean tan buenas o no <i>puedan</i> ser igualmente felices y exitosas. Simplemente significa que, estadísticamente, ciertos estilos de personalidades tienden a correlacionarse con la felicidad.</p><span><h2>👥 Interpersonal</h2></span><p>Tener un test de personalidad increíblemente preciso es interesante, sin duda.</p><p>Aprendes sobre ti mismo, puedes tomar decisiones que coincidan con lo que realmente tú eres en tu vida y en tus relaciones. Tal vez los resultados de tu personalidad incluso te \"den permiso\" para ser tú mismo.</p><p><b>Pero el mayor beneficio de Interpersonality no es leer tu propio perfil.</b></p><p>Es usarlo para aprender acerca de tus amigos, familiares, compañeros de trabajo y pareja - y <b> para mejorar tus relaciones.</b></p><p>Después de realizar el test, puedes ver el perfil de tus amigos o de cualquier persona si tienes el enlace de perfil privado. Con cada una de estas personas, hay una sección especial en tu perfil que tú puedes usar para comparar sus personalidades y conocer sus afinidades y diferencias. Se llama <i>Afinidad interpersonal</i>, que significa \"entre personas.\" De ahí proviene nuestro nombre.</p><p>También verás el puntaje de afinidad con estas personas - un porcentaje el cual mide cuán similares son sus personalidades.</p><p>Descubrirás que después de leer la página de Afinidad interpersonal, entenderás a las personas con más claridad que nunca. De repente muchas cosas tendrán sentido.</p><p>Cuando entiendes y aceptas a los demás por lo que realmente son, es increíble cuánto pueden mejorar tus relaciones de un día a otro.</p><p><b>Este es el verdadero objetivo de Interpersonality - ayudarte a mejorar tus relaciones.</b></p>",

        OUR_MODEL_SIDE_NAV_4_DESC:"<h3>Los \"cinco grandes\"</h3><p>Aquellos que estén familiarizados con la psicometría y la psicología de la personalidad sabrán sobre los cinco grandes.</p><p>Los cinco grandes es el único modelo de personalidad validado estadísticamente, y es lo que los investigadores usan con mayor frecuencia cuando realizan estudios que involucran la medición de la personalidad. Los académicos no usan el Myers-Briggs® u otros test populares, ya que durante mucho tiempo lo han refutado como pseudociencia (1).</p><div className='ourmodel_div_with_margin'><p>(1) Miles de psicólogos profesionales han evaluado el Myers-Briggs que ya tiene 100 años de antigüedad, encontraron que es inexacto y arbitrario, y han ideado mejores sistemas para evaluar la personalidad. - VOX</p><p>\"Simplemente no hay evidencia detrás de esto\", dice Adam Grant, psicólogo organizacional de la Universidad de Pensilvania que ha escrito anteriormente acerca de las deficiencias de Myers-Briggs. \"Las características medidas por el test casi no tienen poder de predicción sobre que tan feliz será una persona en una situación, como se desempeñará en su trabajo o que tan feliz será en su matrimonio\".</p><br/><p><i>El indicador del tipo Myers-Briggs, Myers-Briggs, MBTI y el logotipo de MBTI son marcas comerciales o marcas comerciales registradas de The Myers & Briggs Foundation en los Estados Unidos y otros países. El logotipo de Myers-Briggs Company es una marca comercial o una marca comercial registrada de The Myers-Briggs Company, en los Estados Unidos y otros países.</i></p></div><p>Los cinco grandes te miden con cinco rasgos centrales, que son características relativamente duraderas que influyen en tu comportamiento en muchas situaciones. Los rasgos son la apertura a la experiencia, conciencia, extraversión, amabilidad y neuroticismo. Las versiones más avanzadas de los cinco grandes, incluyendo la nuestra, dividen estos cinco en más sub-rasgos para un total de 30 rasgos.</p><p>Desafortunadamente, cuando obtienes los resultados de un test de los cinco grandes, en realidad no te dicen nada útil o accionable. \"Oh, soy 63% extrovertido y 43% amable, pero <i>¿qué significa esto realmente?\"</i></p><p>Los cinco grandes, en última instancia, es un modelo de rasgos, no un modelo de personalidad. Está validado estadísticamente y es exacto, pero realmente no te dice mucho.</p><p>Interpersonality cambia esto.</p><p>Nos hemos basado en los cinco grandes y hemos desarrollado algo más útil.</p><p>Nuestro test de personalidad utiliza 120 preguntas que evalúan los cinco rasgos principales con seis facetas dentro de cada uno de los cinco grandes, para un total de 30 facetas. Nuestro cuestionario utiliza las 120 preguntas de dominio público desarrolladas por John Johnson, profesor emérito de psicología de la Universidad Estatal de Pennsylvania, presentado en su artículo <a target='_blank' href='https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0092656614000506?via%3Dihub'>\"Midiendo treinta facetas del modelo de cinco factores con un inventario de dominio público de 120 ítems: desarrollo del IPIP-NEO 120\"</a> y compartido en el sitio <a href='https://ipip.ori.org/30FacetNEO-PI-RItems.htm' target='_blank'>Grupo internacional de elementos de personalidad (IPIP)</a>.</p><p>Esto nos da una base científica que nosotros utilizamos.</p><p>Para desarrollar nuestro modelo, le dimos a 163,000 personas estas 120 preguntas de los cinco grandes, más la edad y el género, y luego continuamos haciéndoles preguntas <i>adicionales.</i></p><p>Estas preguntas adicionales fueron las 9,000 descripciones de personalidad mencionadas al principio de esta página, que van desde como se comportó alguien después de una ruptura a como las personas prefieren comunicarse con su jefe y que tipo de vacaciones toman.</p><p>De estos datos fue donde desarrollamos nuestro modelo de personalidad.</p><p>Esencialmente, hemos tomado los cinco grandes y, a través de nuestra investigación, lo hicimos realmente útil al relacionar los treinta rasgos de los cinco grandes sabiendo <i>como se manifiestan para las personas</i> en las áreas más importantes de sus vidas: romance, conflicto, trabajo, estilos de pensamiento, y estilo de vida.</p><p>Es imposible para una <i>persona</i> predecir cual es la personalidad de alguien con solo mirar únicamente sus puntajes de rasgos, y mucho menos con todos sus matices. Esto se debe a que los 30 rasgos son información aislada, y lo importante es como interactúan las combinaciones específicas. La avanzada inteligencia artificial de nuestro modelo puede manejar esta complejidad, lo cual nos permite descubrir patrones que no son del todo obvios. Incluso como expertos en personalidades, nos sorprendimos una y otra vez por los resultados de nuestro propio modelo.</p><h3>El documento completo de la investigación</h3><p>Si deseas profundizar en todos los detalles un poco nerd, lee el documento completo de la <a href='/data-driven-personality-model' >investigación</a> Está escrito para académicos y es increíblemente detallado.</p>",
        OUR_MODEL_SIDE_NAV_5:"El efecto Barnum",
        OUR_MODEL_SIDE_NAV_5_DESC:"<p>Una pregunta común que recibimos sobre nuestro modelo de personalidad es, \"¿cómo saben que no están diciendo cosas con las que todos estarían de acuerdo?\"</p><p>Para responder a esto, déjanos compartirte una historia.</p><p><p><blockquote className='ourmodel_blockquote'><i>En 1948, en lo que se ha descrito como un \"experimento clásico\", el psicólogo Bertram R. Forer hizo una prueba de psicología - llamada \"Diagnóstico blanco de interés\" - a sus 39 estudiantes de psicología, a quienes se les dijo que cada uno recibiría una descripción corta de personalidad o un resumen basado en los resultados de sus pruebas. Una semana después, Forer le dio a cada estudiante una descripción corta supuestamente individualizada y le pidió a cada uno de ellos que lo calificara según su resultado. En realidad, cada alumno recibió la misma descripción, que constaba de los siguientes elementos:</p><p>1. Tienes gran necesidad de que otras personas te quieran y te admiren.</p><p>2. Tienes tendencia a ser crítico contigo mismo.</p><p>3. Tiene muchas capacidades sin usar que no has aprovechado.</p><p>4. Aunque tienes algunas debilidades en tu personalidad, generalmente puedes compensarlas.</p><p>5. Tu adaptación sexual ha presentado problemas para ti.</p><p>6. Eres disciplinado y con autocontrol por fuera, pero tiendes a ser inquieto e inseguro por dentro.</p><p>7. A veces tienes serias dudas sobre si has tomado la decisión correcta o si has hecho lo correcto.</p><p>8. Prefieres una cierta cantidad de cambios y variedad y te sientes insatisfecho cuando te rodean las restricciones y las limitaciones.</p><p>9. Te enorgulleces por ser un pensador independiente y no aceptas las afirmaciones de los demás sin una prueba suficiente.</p><p>10. Te ha parecido imprudente ser demasiado directo al revelarte a los demás.</p><p>11. A veces eres extrovertido, amable, sociable, mientras que otras veces eres introvertido, cauteloso, reservado.</p><p>12. Algunas de tus aspiraciones tienden a ser poco realistas.</p><p>13. La seguridad es uno de sus principales objetivos en la vida.</p><p>En promedio, los estudiantes calificaron la descripción con un 4,30 en una escala de 0 (muy deficiente) a 5 (excelente). Sólo después de que se entregaron las calificaciones se reveló que cada estudiante había recibido una descripción idéntica realizada por Forer de un libro de astrología de un puesto revistas.</i> -<a href='https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efecto_Forer' target='_blank'> Wikipedia</a></blockquote></p></p><p>Si eres como la mayoría de personas, probablemente estés de acuerdo con las 12 afirmaciones anteriores. Esto se debe al 'efecto Barnum':</p><p><blockquote className='ourmodel_blockquote'><i>El efecto Barnum es un fenómeno psicológico común en el cual las personas dan una calificación de gran exactitud a las descripciones de su personalidad las cuales supuestamente están diseñadas específicamente para ellos, pero que de hecho son descripciones suficientemente vagas y generales como para aplicarlas a un gran número de personas.</i> -<a href='https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efecto_Forer' target='_blank'> Wikipedia</a></blockquote></p><p>Si has tomado otro test de personalidad y sentiste que fue bastante preciso, es muy probable que parte de la razón por la cual estuviste de acuerdo con este, es por el efecto Barnum. </p><p>Entonces, la pregunta \"¿cómo sabes que no estás diciendo cosas con las que todos estarían de acuerdo?\" es una buena pregunta.</p><h3>Haciendo las cosas distintivas</h3><p>Nosotros somos muy conscientes de este efecto. En vez de usarlo para asegurarnos de que las personas estén fácilmente de acuerdo con su perfil de personalidad, lo evitamos. Nos enfocamos en lo que realmente es diferente entre las personas. Lo que te hace ser <i>tú mismo</i>, no lo que hace a todas las personas ser seres humanos comunes y corrientes.</p><p>Después de recopilar datos para las 9.000 descripciones de personalidades, las filtramos. Ignoramos cualquier descripción con la cual todas las personas estuvieran de acuerdo para asegurarnos de que sólo hablábamos de cosas distintivas.</p><p>Evitamos decir cosas con las que todas las personas estarían de acuerdo, porque el propósito es que los demás te comprendan a ti y que tú comprendas a los demás para mejorar tus relaciones. Si tu perfil fuera solo algo superficial para sentirte bien, no sería muy útil.</p><p>Por lo tanto, todo lo que lees en tu perfil es específico para ti.</p>",

        COLLABORATE_ON_RESEARCH_DESC: "<p>Colaboramos con investigadores académicos, autores respetados y otros líderes de opinión para realizar investigaciones nuevas sobre la psicología de la personalidad.</p><p>Históricamente, una limitación importante para los investigadores psicométricos ha sido el acceso a buenos conjuntos de datos. Muchos investigadores tienen que conformarse con encuestar a unos cientos de estudiantes que estudian psicología o temas relacionados en su universidad. Estas muestras suelen ser demasiado pequeñas para tener una validez estadística sólida y están sesgadas, ya que a menudo utilizan poblaciones auto-seleccionadas con intereses y datos demográficos específicos.</p><p><b>Tenemos la misión de cambiar esto</b> poniendo a disposición de los investigadores grandes muestras de encuestas con menos sesgo de selección.</p><h3>¿Cómo funciona?</h3><p>Nuestro test de personalidad tiene 120 preguntas que evalúan \"Los cinco grandes\" rasgos con seis facetas principales dentro de cada uno de \"Los cinco grandes\", para un total de 30 facetas. Nuestro cuestionario utiliza las 120 preguntas de dominio público desarrolladas por John Johnson, profesor emérito de psicología de la Universidad Estatal de Pennsylvania, presentado en su artículo \"<a href='https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0092656614000506?via%3Dihub' target=\"_blank\">Measuring thirty facets of the Five Factor Model with a 120-item public domain inventory: Development of the IPIP-NEO-120</a>\" y compartido en la página web <a href='https://ipip.ori.org/30FacetNEO-PI-RItems.htm' target=\"_blank\">International Personality Item Pool</a> (IPIP)</p><p>Al realizar investigaciones, después de que los visitantes de nuestro sitio hayan completado el test de \"Los cinco grandes\" de 120 preguntas de Johnson, les mostramos preguntas opcionales adicionales. Estas preguntas son generalmente frases simples o párrafos cortos con los cuales el usuario puede estar de acuerdo o en desacuerdo en una <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likert_scale' target=\"_blank\">escala Likert</a> de -3 a +3. Por ejemplo, \"Tengo un plan trazado para mi vida\". Para cada una de estas preguntas adicionales, normalmente recopilamos 1.000 respuestas. El número exacto de respuestas se puede ajustar para garantizar la validez estadística en función de los requisitos del proyecto de investigación actual.</p><p>También recopilamos la edad, el género, la ubicación geográfica y la preferencia del idioma (actualmente en inglés y español).</p><p>Esto nos permite recopilar grandes volúmenes de datos de encuestas para \"los cinco grandes\" rasgos principales (y treinta facetas), datos demográficos y respuestas a las preguntas que estamos investigando actualmente. Al momento de escribir este artículo (7 de octubre de 2020), hemos encuestado a 167,322 personas y recibido 16,993,597 respuestas a 9,394 preguntas de investigación.</p><p><b>Estas preguntas adicionales son sobre como podemos apoyar investigaciones en curso.</b> Como podemos agregar cualquier pregunta que nos guste a las preguntas adicionales, podemos respaldar cualquier investigación legítima y ética sobre las relaciones entre los rasgos de los cinco grandes, la demografía y otros factores que van desde el estilo de vida, relaciones familiares y relaciones románticas, la trayectoria profesional, los resultados de la vida, etc.</p><p>Estamos con ganas de colaborar con investigadores académicos, autores respetados y otros líderes de opinión para realizar juntos investigaciones nuevas.<p/><p>Si tu interés de investigación es un buen complemento, nosotros:<p/><ol className=\"collaborate_on_reasearch\"><li>Trabajamos contigo para escribir las preguntas adicionales que le haríamos a nuestros usuarios y establecemos el número de respuestas necesarias para la validez estadística. Tenemos la capacidad de probar rápidamente una gran cantidad de preguntas.</li><li>Recopilamos la cantidad requerida de respuestas a cada pregunta de usuarios de todo el mundo.</li><li>Analizamos los resultados contigo y publicamos un documento contigo sobre los hallazgos. Este análisis y el proceso de escritura del artículo lo podemos hacer contigo si eres un investigador académico o para ti si estás menos familiarizado con la psicometría y el análisis estadístico. Por lo general, publicamos un resumen de los resultados de la investigación en nuestro blog y te recomendamos que publiques los resultados en cualquier otro lugar.</li></ol><p><b>Colaborar con nosotros en investigaciones no tiene ningún costo.</b> Somos una empresa que prioriza la investigación, y la colaboración en investigación es tanto parte de nuestra misión al igual que una forma de retribución.<p/><p>Aunque no podemos decir que sí a todos los que solicitan realizar una investigación con nosotros, sí consideramos y respondemos a cada solicitud.<p/><p>Si está interesado en colaborar en investigaciones, por favor ponte en contacto con <a href='mailto:research@interpersonality.com'>research@interpersonality.com</a>.</p>",

        RESEARCH_ARTICLE_ABSTRACT_CONTENT: "<p>Our research objective was to build a novel personality type model that is comprehensive in the range of human psychology it covers, simple to understand, and statistically validated for accuracy. We surveyed 144,164 individuals, who completed standard Big Five tests (input variables). We also collected respondents' responses to 9,394 descriptions, covering a wide range of personality and behavioral topics (output variables). In total, we collected 16,181,276 ratings of output variables.  Using these data, we applied various machine learning approaches to develop a novel personality type model. We discovered that historical concepts of personality type cannot be used to develop a comprehensive and statistically sound personality type model. In order to be comprehensive and have enough detail to be insightful, the number of personality types needed was much too large. Instead, in our model resulting from this research, we identified 14 separate personality themes (e.g. Extraversion, Conflict, Emotions) with between 2 and 8 styles within each theme. Each person's personality is made up of their style in each of the 14 themes. This allows for great detail and insight while still being simple enough to understand. In total, there are 29,859,840 potential combinations of styles. The ability to generate about 30 million personality reports matches the complexity of human personality better than existing models, which typically only generate reports covering 16 personality types.</p>",

        RESEARCH_ARTICLE_DMCM: "2.1 Dichotomous Models vs. Continuous Models",
        RESEARCH_ARTICLE_DMCM_CONTENT: "<p>Almost all personality type models use four personality traits to construct their personality type models, so in this section, we'll assume the personality type model has four traits. (The traits used in different models to construct their personality types differ widely, but almost all models use four traits.)<br><br>A few personality models, such as DiSC, provide trait score results on a continuous scale. (Although with the caveat that DiSC uses an ipsative scale, which we discuss below.)<br><br>However, most personality models form their type system by dividing people into one or other extreme of a trait - above or below some cutoff point of the trait score in that dimension. For example, MBTI<sup>®</sup> classifies people into Extraverted <u>or</u> Introverted. They then define the different personality types as combinations of one or other of those extremes in each trait dimension.<br><br>With four measured traits in the model, this creates 2<sup>4</sup> = 16 personality types.<br><br>The problem with this approach is that for any measurable personality trait, people fall on roughly normal distributions, with most people being close to the mean, and a few outliers being near the high or low extremes.<ol className=\"research_article_ol\"><li className=\"li_style_none\">For example, see <a href='https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.391.4682&rep=rep1&type=pdf' target='_blank'>Bess & Harvey, 2001</a> for an analysis of the distribution of people across the four MBTI trait scores.</li><li className=\"li_style_none\">Similarly, our own data show roughly normal distributions of scores across the Big Five traits and across all 30 sub-facets of the Big Five.</li></ol>Thus, defining an arbitrary cutoff point between 'high' and 'low' on a trait dimension creates a false dichotomy between types of people. For example, categorizing people into extraverted <u>or</u> introverted and misses the midline 'ambiverts' who are neither highly extraverted nor highly introverted.<br><br>As most people are actually midline on most personality traits, this is a serious shortcoming. It means that most existing models fail to describe most people accurately on most of the trait dimensions the models use.<br><br>Thus, a key objective in our attempt to develop a new personality model was to ensure that the model accounted for the roughly normal distribution of people across trait dimensions, and accurately describe people who fall near the middle of trait dimensions.</p>",
        RESEARCH_ARTICLE_LIMITED_SCOPE: "2.2 Limited Scope",
        RESEARCH_ARTICLE_LIMITED_SCOPE_CONTENT: "<p>The breadth of human psychology and behavior is vast and the number of personality traits that <u><i>could</i></u> be measured and used to build a personality type model is equally vast.<br><br>Obviously, the more traits that are taken into account when building a personality type model, the more opportunity there is to build a <u>comprehensive</u> model.<br><br>However, there are challenges that come with increasing the number of traits used to build a model.

Marston published his book on the \"Emotions of Normal People\" in 1928, which is the foundation for the DiSC<sup>®</sup> Personality System. This research was all conducted long before computing power was generally available. More modern personality type models were also developed before the creation of \"Data Science\" as a discipline - a term that was first used in 2001.<br><br>Thus personality type models had to be restricted to:<ul className=\"li_style_bullet\"><li>A process for tallying test results to assign a person to their personality type that was simple enough to easily calculate by hand on paper.<li>A personality model that was simple enough to be created by a human mind, without recourse to computationally-intensive machine learning.</li></li></ul></li></ul></p>",

        RESEARCH_ARTICLE_STATISTICAL_PERSPECTIVE_CONTENT: "<p><ul><li className=\"li_style_none\">The limitations of the human brain aside, the complexity of building a personality type model grows exponentially with the number of traits considered.<br><br>For example, as existing models create personality types based on combinations of dichotomies, if there are n traits in the model, there are 2<sup>n</sup> possible combinations of the two extremes, and thus 2<sup>n</sup> personality types.

        RESEARCH_ARTICLE_FALSE_DISTINCTIONS_CONTENT: "<p className='research_remove_paragraph_bottom_margin'>Some personality tests use Likert scales for their test questions, while others use ipsative or forced-choice questions.<br><br>Likert scales allow the user to respond on a scale of agreement or disagreement to a statement. The rating scales typically allow responses on an integer scale, for example from -3 (strongly disagree) to +3 (strongly agree).<br><br>Ipsative, or forced-choice, questions do not allow for gradations in agreement or disagreement, and prevent neutral responses.

We cover the choice of our test questions in detail in section 3.4.<br><br>In our data gathering (see section 4.2), we asked people to respond to 120 personality test questions and then asked them to rate their agreement or disagreement to additional, optional personality descriptions on the same Likert scale of -3 to +3. The sources of those additional descriptions are described in section 4.2.1.<br><br>For example, we tested a wide range of response questions relating to <i>how</i> people like to be shown affection. As we used a Likert scale, we were also able to capture and evaluate not only <i>how</i> people liked to be shown affection but also <i>how important</i> being shown affection was to them.<br><br>Dr. Gary Chapman, author of the book The Five Love Languages, explored the same topic, using an ipsative questionnaire.<br><br>After taking Chapman's Love Languages test, people are told that the results give them accurate information on how they most like to be shown affection.<br><br>Technically, that is true. But it misses the forest for the trees.<br><br>Using a Likert questionnaire, we discovered that the biggest distinction between groups of people is that some people really do care about receiving demonstrations of affection, while for others it's just not that important. Among those who do place importance on receiving demonstrations of affection, there is one sub-group that places more importance on physical touch than others, but this distinction was much less marked than the differences between people who do and don't care about receiving demonstrations of affection.<br><br>We found similar patterns when we investigated other themes such as communication styles, leadership styles and negotiation styles. When we compared our results to other tests that covered similar topics using ipsative questionnaires, we generally found that the biggest distinction was whether people cared about the topic or not, and the distinctions drawn from the ipsative tests were much smaller than their personality test results suggest. Some people are great communicators and others are not, but the minusca of their differences in style were less important. Some people like to be leaders and others prefer to follow, but the differences in leadership styles were small compared to their overall preference to lead or follow. Some people have great negotiation skills and others do not, but the differences in the negotiation styles of good negotiators were much less pronounced.<br><br>In general, we conclude that forced ranking tests often produce false distinctions that do not reflect people's real preferences. These tests can indeed be useful and interesting. However, when considering the macro picture of a person's personality, they do not represent significant differences between people.<br><br>Having settled on using a Likert scale for our personality test, the next question was, which personality traits would we measure to build our model? And which personality test would we use to assess those traits?</p>",
        RESEARCH_ARTICLE_BIG_FIVE_TEST: "3. The Big Five Test",
        RESEARCH_ARTICLE_BIG_FIVE_TEST_CONTENT: "<p>The Big Five (see Chapter 5 in the Handbook of personality: Theory and research, 2nd Edition) is the one of the very few statistically-validated personality trait tests for normal psychology. (\"Normal\" here as distinct from tests of psychopathology, such as the <a href=\"https://www.upress.umn.edu/test-division/bibliography/mmpi-history\" target='_blank'>Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory</a> (Starke & Hathaway, 1937), which is a statistically validated and well researched test, but does not measure normal psychology).<br><br>The Big Five measures five core traits, which are relatively enduring characteristics that influence behavior across many situations. The traits are Openness to Experience, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism.<br><br>The original Big Five test was the NEO Personality Inventory <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232516614_The_NEO_Personality_Inventory_Using_the_Five-Factor_Model_in_counseling\" target='_blank'>(Costa & McCrae, 1991)</a>. Since then, several other tests, measuring the same Big Five traits, have been developed.

        RESEARCH_ARTICLE_ORTHOGONAL_TRAITS: "3.1 Orthogonal Traits",
        RESEARCH_ARTICLE_ORTHOGONAL_TRAITS_CONTENT: "<p>One major technical advantage of the Big Five is that the five traits have been shown to be orthogonal, i.e. each trait is independent of each other - there are near-zero cross correlations between the different traits when sampled across different people. From a mathematical perspective, this is a huge advantage, as working with an orthogonal input vector space makes it much easier to analyze relationships between inputs (trait scores) and outputs (users' Likert-scale responses to descriptions about their personality).<br><br>This is in contrast to many other personality trait models. For example, with the Myers-Briggs test, research has shown that the four traits are not orthogonal, and one of the traits does not even measure opposites, but rather two different things (judging and perceiving) where people can in reality score high for <u>both</u> judging and perceiving but the test does not allow this result. <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2709300/\" target='_blank'>(McCrae and Costa, 1989)</a><br><br>From a data science perspective, using traits that are not orthogonal creates difficult technical problems.

        RESEARCH_ARTICLE_RESTEST_RELIABILITY_CONTENT: "<p className='research_remove_paragraph_bottom_margin'>An important factor in choosing a personality test and trait model is the test-retest reliability. A test is said to have high test-retest reliability if there are strong correlations between the test results when a person takes and retakes the same test at different times. Some existing personality tests have been shown to have lower test-retest reliability. For example, with the official Myers-Briggs test, when people retake the test, two or more of their assigned type preferences <a href='https://www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbti-personality-type/mbti-basics/reliability-and-validity.htm#:~:text=Facts%20about%20the%20MBTI%C2%AE%20instrument%20reliability%3A&text=On%20retest%2C%20people%20come%20out,to%2090%25%20of%20the%20time.&text=The%20reliabilities%20are%20quite%20good%20across%20most%20age%20and%20ethnic%20groups.' target='_blank'>change between 10% to 25% of the time</a>.<br><br>The NEO PI-R and other versions of the Big Five test have been shown to have high test-retest reliability.<ul><li className=\"li_style_none\">The test-retest reliability of the NEO PI-R has also been found to be satisfactory. The test-retest reliability of an early version of the NEO after 3 months was: N = .87, E = .91, O = .86. The test-retest reliability for over 6 years, as reported in the NEO PI-R manual, was the following: N = .83, E = .82, O = .83, A = .63, C = .79. Costa and McCrae pointed out that these findings not only demonstrate good reliability of the domain scores, but also their stability (among individuals over the age of 30).

It's important that the test and results are not different from one culture to another.<br><br><ul><li className=\"li_style_none\">Evidence of the NEO scales' stability in different countries and cultures can be considered evidence of its validity. A great deal of cross-cultural research has been carried out on the Five-Factor Model of Personality. Much of the research has relied on the NEO PI-R and the shorter NEO-FFI. McCrae and Allik (2002) edited a book consisting of papers bearing on cross-cultural research on the FFM. Research from China, Estonia, Finland, the Philippines, France, German-speaking countries, India, Portugal, Russia, South Korean, Turkey, Vietnam, and Zimbabwe have shown the FFM to be robust across cultures.<br><br/>Rolland, on the basis of the data from a number of countries, asserted that the neuroticism, openness, and conscientiousness dimensions are cross-culturally valid. Rolland further advanced the view that the extraversion and agreeableness dimensions are more sensitive to cultural context. Age differences in the five-factors of personality across the adult life span are parallel in samples from Germany, Italy, Portugal, Croatia, and South Korea. Data examined from many different countries have shown that the age and gender differences in those countries resembled differences found in U.S. samples. An intercultural factor analysis yielded a close approximation to the five-factor model. McCrae, Terracciano et al. (2005) further reported data from 51 cultures.

If a theme has n styles, each style occupies a 32-dimensional polygonal volume in the trait space, bounded by up to n - 1 31-dimensional (sloped) planes.</p><p>Importantly, we found that our machine learning algorithms could correctly identify 'midline' personality styles, such as the Ambiverted style in the Introverted-Extravert spectrum.</p><p>It's important to note that the shape of these 'midline' styles are more nuanced than just being the average between two extremes. For example, considering the Extraversion theme described in section 5.6.2.1., according to our data, Ambiverts are not just simple averages between Extraverts and Introverts. As discussed in section section 5.6.2.1, the three facets that play the most important role in determining which of these three styles a person falls into are Friendliness, Depression and Anxiety.</p><p className='research_remove_paragraph_bottom_margin'>The following diagram illustrates the boundaries between the three styles in relation to the three facets of Friendliness, Depression and Anxiety. This is an illustration of the relationships rather than an exact plot generated from data.</p><ul className=\"research_article_ol\"><li className='li_style_none'>Geometrically the diagram represents a 3-dimensional cross-section in the three dimensions of Friendliness, Anxiety and Depression through the 32-dimensional space, and then takes a 2-dimensional cross section looking towards the origin point of the three facet axes. This is an illustrative chart rather than an exact plot based on actual data.</li><li className='li_style_none'>It would be possible to develop algorithms to find an appropriate 3-dimensional plane in the 32-dimensional space to take the first cross section, and then find an appropriate 2-dimensional plane to take the second cross section and then generate an exact plot of the boundaries between these styles at that location in the trait space.</li><li className='li_style_none'>However, developing these algorithms would be a non-trivial task and an exact plot would not add anything to the illustrative diagram below. Thus, in this case, we opted to show an illustrative diagram rather than an exact plot.</li></ul><img src='{0}' /> <ul><li>The higher a person scores on the Friendliness facet, the more likely they are to fall into the Extravert or Ambivert styles.</li><li>The higher a person scores on the Anxiety facet, the more likely they are to fall into the Extravert or Introvert styles.</li><li>The higher a person scores on the Depression facet, the more likely they are to fall into the Introvert style.</li></ul><p>Thus Ambiversion is not just an average between Extraversion and Introversion.</p><p>We found that in every theme with three or more styles, each style has its unique and distinctive characteristics, with nuanced relationships between each pair of styles.</p>",

        RESEARCH_ARTICLE_STATISTICAL_CRITERIA_FOR_CONTENT:"<p>Once we had identified the 14 themes and their component styles, we needed to write the descriptions for each style.</p><p>To do this, we needed to have statistics on the predicted scores people assigned to each style  would have for each output description used in the theme.</p><p className='research_remove_paragraph_bottom_margin'>To generate these data, we developed a machine learning algorithm that performed the following steps:</p><ol><li>Sample the trait scores of users who had taken our test</li><li>Predict the output score each user would give to each output description used in the theme (using our linear regression models)</li><li>Assign each sample user to a style within the theme</li><li>Assemble summary statistics of the predicted output scores of each output description in the theme for each user assigned to the theme:<ul><li>Mean score of users within the style</li><li>Standard deviation of scores for users within the style</li><li>Difference between the mean score of all users within the style and the mean score of all users not in the style</li></ul></li></ol><p className='research_remove_paragraph_bottom_margin'>This gave us statistics for writing the summary descriptions for each style, whereby we could ensure that:</p><ul><li>What we said about a style was <u>accurate</u></li><li>What we said about a style was <u>distinctive</u> from what we said about other styles</li><li>We had <u>high confidence</u> that what we wrote about a style would be accurate for the vast majority of people assigned to the style</li></ul><p>As a general guideline, we ignored output descriptions that had low differentiation between styles (thus avoiding the Barun Effect), and wrote the style descriptions based on the 84% confidence level of predicted score (one standard deviation from the mean) for people in the style.</p><p>There was one exception to these guidelines. For styles that were truly midline for all of the output descriptions in the theme, we could not write about what was <u>different</u> about them, as they were entirely normal or average. In those cases, we wrote for what would be true of them, even though that would also be true for people in other themes. This allowed us to capture and describe truly midline styles in a way that was statistically meaningful and valid.</p><p>In writing style descriptions, we were rigorous about not interpolating from the <u>data</u> we did have to what our behavioral experts <u>thought</u> would be true of people in that style. There were many long discussions relating our behavioral expertise to the data, where our behavioral expertise would say something like, \"Well, obviously people in this style would also be like X.\" and the data would rebut with \"If there's no data to support it, we cannot assume it and cannot write it.\"</p>",

        RESEARCH_ARTICLE_INFLUENCE_OF_FACTES_CONTENT:"<p>In the discussions below, we refer to the 30 facets of the Big Five model. Those facets are defined by the scoring key of the test we use, which you can find <a href='https://ipip.ori.org/30FacetNEO-PI-RItems.htm' target='_blank'>here</a>.</p><p>For each of our styles within each theme, we assembled statistics on the means and standard deviations of facet scores of all people in our sample assigned to the style, plus information about their age and gender. From looking at these mean scores and standard deviations, we can draw some broad conclusions about the relationship between the traits and the style.</p><p>The standard deviation across the mean scores of each facet in each style gives an indication of how influential that facet is in defining the theme. When the standard deviation across the mean scores of a facet across styles is high, it indicates that the machine learning algorithm partitions individuals into styles with high dependence on that facet. When that measure is low, it indicates that that facet does not play an important role in assigning an individual to a facet. </p><p>In the discussion below, when we list the facets that play the most important role in each theme, they are listed in order of the standard deviation of the mean scores of each facet in each style, highest first, so that we show the most influential facets first.</p><p>Having said that, it's important to keep in mind that an individual is assigned to a style based on their entire 30 facet scores plus age and gender, so while some facets play more or less important roles in a theme in <i>general</i>, a specific individual's score may differ greatly from the mean scores in the style.</p><ul><li className='li_style_none'>For example, on average, people in the Assertive style of the Conflict Dynamics theme have higher than average scores for the Depression facet. However, we have a team member who scores very low on the Depression facet but still belongs in the Assertive style - based both on the algorithm that assigns individuals to facets and his own and his colleagues' assessment of his behaviours in regard to this theme.</li></ul><p>Thus, while exploring the facets that have most impact on assigning individuals to styles is illustrative of general patterns, it's important to remember that a person's full 30 facet score plus age and gender are used to actually assign individuals to styles - and individual results can vary quite widely from general patterns.</p>",

The data tell a different story from common perceptions of extraversion-introversion.</p><p className='research_remove_paragraph_bottom_margin'>The most influential traits for the Extraversion theme are:</p><ol><li>The Friendliness facet from the Extraversion theme</li><li>The Depression facet from the Neuroticism theme</li><li>The Anxiety facet from the Neuroticism theme</li><li>The Self-Consciousness facet from the Neuroticism theme</li><li>The Vulnerability facet from the Neuroticism theme</li><li>The Gregariousness facet from the Extraversion theme</li><li>The Self-Discipline facet from the Conscientiousness theme</li><li>The Cheerfulness facet from the Extraversion theme</li></ol><p>It would be reasonable to assume that all six facets of the Extraversion theme would play important roles in the Extraversion theme, but this turns out not to be the case. Three of the six extraversion facets turn out to be relatively less important than facets related to Neuroticism and Conscientiousness.</p><p>Extraverts and Ambiverts tend to have higher scores for Friendliness than Introverts.</p><p>Extraverts and Ambiverts tend to have lower scores for Depression than Introverts. This is consistent with research that has found a correlation between the amount of social time people have in their lives and depression.</p><p>Extraverts and Ambiverts tend to have lower scores for Vulnerability than Introverts.</p><p>Interestingly, both Extraverts and Introverts tend to score high for Anxiety, while Ambiverts tend to score lower.</p><p>Extraverts and Ambiverts tend to score lower for Self-Consciousness than Introverts.</p><p>The average scores for Gregariousness follow the pattern one would expect: Extraverts are the most gregarious, Ambiverts are in the middle, and Introverts tend to score low.</p><p>Extraverts and Ambiverts score somewhat higher on Self-Discipline than Introverts.</p><p>Extraverts and Ambiverts tend to have similarly high scores for Cheerfulness while Introverts tend to have lower scores.</p><p>Age also plays a role in this theme. There are more young extraverts and introverts, and as people age, there are more Ambiverts.</p><p>The way the different Big Five traits and facets play out in this theme illustrate the benefits of taking a data-driven, machine learning approach to building a personality type model over an approach relying only on human intuition. Human intuition would argue for defining personality styles for Extraverts, Ambiverts and Introverts based only on the Big Five Extraversion trait and its six facets, but it turns out that other traits and facets play equally important roles.</p>",
